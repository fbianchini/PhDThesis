abstract = {Planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bands between 30 and 857 GHz. These observations allow robust reconstruction of the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations over nearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on Galactic foregrounds, including thermal dust and line emission from molecular carbon monoxide (CO). This paper describes the component separation framework adopted by Planck for many cosmological analyses, including CMB power spectrum determination and likelihood construction on large angular scales, studies of primordial non-Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, gravitational lensing, and searches for topological defects. We test four foreground-cleaned CMB maps derived using qualitatively different component separation algorithms. The quality of our reconstructions is evaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shown through various tests to be internally consistent and robust for CMB power spectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to {\{}$\backslash$ell{\}} = 2000. The parameter constraints on {\{}{\$}\Lambda{\$}{\}}CDM cosmologies derived from these maps are consistent with those presented in the cross-spectrum based Planck likelihood analysis. We choose two of the CMB maps for specific scientific goals. We also present maps and frequency spectra of the Galactic low-frequency, CO, and thermal dust emission. The component maps are found to provide a faithful representation of the sky, as evaluated by simulations, with the largest bias seen in the CO component at 3{\%}. For the low-frequency component, the spectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about {\{}{\$}\beta{\$}{\}} = -4 to - 2. Considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index ({\{}{\$}\beta{\$}{\}}{\$}\backslashlt{\$} -3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinning dust spectrum peaking below 20 GHz, a flat index of {\{}{\$}\beta{\$}{\}}{\$}\backslashgt{\$} -2.3 with strong free-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.},

abstract = {We test for foreground residuals in the foreground cleaned Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps outside and inside U73 mask commonly used for cosmological analysis. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new method to validate masks by looking at the differences in cleaned maps obtained by different component separation methods. By analyzing the power spectrum as well as the mean, variance and skewness of needlet coefficients on bands outside and inside the U73 mask we first confirm that the pixels already masked by U73 are highly contaminated and cannot be used for cosmological analysis. We further find that the U73 mask needs extension in order to reduce large scale foreground residuals to a level of less than {\$}20\backslash{\%}{\$} of the standard deviation of CMB fluctuations within the bands closest to the galactic equator. We also find 276 point sources in the cleaned foreground maps which are currently not masked by the U73 mask. Our final publicly available extended mask leaves {\$}65.9\backslash{\%}{\$} of the sky for cosmological analysis. Note that this extended mask may be important for analyses on local sky patches; in full sky analyses the additional residuals near the galactic equator may average out.},

abstract = {We present new methods for mapping the curl-free (E-mode) and divergence-free (B-mode) components of spin 2 signals using spin directional wavelets. Our methods are equally applicable to measurements of the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the shear of galaxy shapes due to weak gravitational lensing. We derive pseudo and pure wavelet estimators, where E-B mixing arising due to incomplete sky coverage is suppressed in wavelet space using scale- and orientation-dependent masking and weighting schemes. In the case of the pure estimator, ambiguous modes (which have vanishing curl and divergence simultaneously on the incomplete sky) are also cancelled. On simulations, we demonstrate the improvement (i.e., reduction in leakage) provided by our wavelet space estimators over standard harmonic space approaches. Our new methods can be directly interfaced in a coherent and computationally-efficient manner with component separation or feature extraction techniques that also exploit wavelets.},

abstract = {We discuss the effect of unresolved point source contamination on estimates of the CMB lensing potential, from components such as the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, radio point sources, and the Cosmic Infrared Background. We classify the possible trispectra associated with such source populations, and construct estimators for the amplitude and scale-dependence of several of the major trispectra. We show how to propagate analytical models for these source trispectra to biases for lensing. We also construct a ``source-hardened'' lensing estimator which experiences significantly smaller biases when exposed to unresolved point sources than the standard quadratic lensing estimator. We demonstrate these ideas in practice using the sky simulations of Sehgal et al., for cosmic-variance limited experiments designed to mimic ACT, SPT, and Planck. We find that for radio sources and SZ the bias is significantly reduced, but for CIB it is essentially unchanged. However, by using the high-frequency, all-sky CIB measurements from Planck and Herschel it may be possible to suppress this contribution.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing, caused by matter perturbations along the line of sight to the last scattering surface, can modify the shape of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectrum. We discuss the detectability of lensing distortions to the temperature, polarization and temperature-polarization cross-correlation power spectra, and we analyse how lensing might affect the estimation of cosmological parameters. For cold dark matter like models with present-day matter power spectra normalized to match the abundances of rich clusters of galaxies, gravitational lensing causes detectable distortions to cosmic variance-limited CMB experiments sampling high multipoles (l {\textgreater}= 1000). Gravitational lensing of the CMB, although a small effect, allows independent determinations of the curvature of the Universe and the cosmological constant, i.e., breaking the so-called geometrical degeneracy in CMB parameter estimation discussed by Bond, Efstathiou {\&} Tegmark and Zaldarriaga, Spergel {\&} Seljak. Gravitational lensing of the CMB temperature and polarization patterns should be detectable by the Planck Surveyor satellite, leading to useful independent constraints on the cosmological constant and spatial curvature.},

abstract = {The cosmological consequences of a pervasive, rolling, self-interacting, homogeneous scalar field are investigated. A number of models in which the energy density of the scalar field red-shifts in a specific manner are studied. In these models the current epoch is chosen to be scalar-field dominated to agree with dynamical estimates of the density parameter, $\Omega$dyn{\~{}}0.2, and zero spatial curvature. The required scalar-field potential is ``nonlinear'' and decreases in magnitude as the value of the scalar field increases. A special solution of the field equations which is an attractive, time-dependent, fixed point is presented. These models are consistent with the classical tests of gravitation theory. The E{\"{o}}tv{\"{o}}s-Dicke measurements strongly constrain the coupling of the scalar field to light (nongravitational) fields. Nucleosynthesis proceeds as in the standard hot big-bang model. In linear perturbation theory the behavior of baryonic perturbations, in the baryon-dominated epoch, do not differ significantly from the canonical scenario, while the presence of a substantial amount of homogeneous scalar-field energy density at low red-shifts inhibits the growth of perturbations in the baryonic fluid. The energy density in the scalar field is not appreciably perturbed by nonrelativistic gravitational fields, either in the radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, or scalar-field-dominated epochs. On the basis of this effect, we argue that these models could reconcile the low dynamical estimates of the mean mass density with the negligibly small spatial curvature preferred by inflation.},

The significance of the detection of the theoretically expected cross-correlation signal is found to be {\$}10\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$}.

On the other hand, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is found to be a factor {\$}1.62 \backslashpm 0.16{\$} higher than expected from the standard model and also found by cross-correlation analyses with other tracers of the large-scale structure. The enhancement due to lensing magnification can account for only a fraction of the excess cross-correlation signal. We suggest that part of it may be due to an incomplete removal of the contamination of the CIB, that includes the H-ATLAS sources we are cross-correlating with. In any case, the highly significant detection reported here using a catalog covering only 1.4$\backslash${\%} of the sky demonstrates the potential of CMB lensing correlations with submillimeter surveys.},

Our detection passes a number of null tests and systematic checks. Using this cross-power spectrum, we measure the amplitude of the linear quasar bias assuming a template for its redshift dependence, and find the amplitude to be consistent with an earlier measurement from clustering; at redshift z≈1.4, the peak of the distribution of quasars in our maps, our measurement corresponds to a bias of b=2.5±0.6.

abstract = {Using the most recent releases of WISE and Planck data, we perform updated measurements of the bias and typical dark matter halo mass of infrared-selected obscured and unobscured quasars, using the angular autocorrelation function and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing cross-correlations. Since our recent work of this kind, the WISE Allwise catalogue was released with improved photometry, and the Planck mission was completed and released improved products. These new data provide a more reliable measurement of the quasar bias and provide an opportunity to explore the role of changing survey pipelines in results downstream. We present a comparison of IR color-selected quasars, split into obscured and unobscured populations based on optical-IR colors, selected from two versions of the WISE data. Which combination of data is used impacts the final results, particularly for obscured quasars, both because of mitigation of some systematics and because the newer catalogue provides a slightly different sample. We show that Allwise data is superior in several ways, though there may be some systematic trends with Moon contamination that were not present in the previous catalogue. We opt currently for the most conservative sample that meet our selection criteria in both the previous and new WISE catalogues. We measure a higher bias and halo mass for obscured quasars ({\$}b{\_}{\{}\backslashtextrm{\{}obsc{\}}{\}} \backslashsim 2.1{\$}, {\$}b{\_}{\{}\backslashtextrm{\{}unob{\}}{\}} \backslashsim 1.8{\$}) --- at odds with simple orientation models --- but at a reduced significance ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}1.5{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}) as compared to our work with previous survey data.},

The galaxy sits on the far-IR/radio correlation for far-IR-selected galaxies. At {\~{}}{\textgreater}70um, the SED can be described adequately by dust components with T(d) {\~{}} 30 and 60K. Using SPIRE's Fourier Transform Spectrometer we report a detection of the [CII] 158um cooling line. If the [CII], CO and far-IR continuum arise in photo-dissociation regions, we derive a characteristic gas density, n {\~{}} 10{\^{}}3 cm{\^{}}-3, and a far-UV radiation field, G{\_}0, 10{\^{}}3x stronger than the Milky Way. L([CII])/L(bol) is significantly higher than in local ULIRGs but similar to the values found in local star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. This is consistent with SMM J2135-0102 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across {\~{}}2 kpc, evidence that SMGs are not simply scaled-up ULIRGs. Our results show that SPIRE's FTS has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscured galaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not be competitive with ground-based CO-line searches. It will, however, allow detailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as well as the chemistry of their ISM, once more suitably bright candidates have been found.},

abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CM B) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions, which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon, and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates the dynamical from the geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows us to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time-consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about 2 orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become with the next generation of experiments. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that maximum likelihood estimators must be used to provide optimal estimates of power spectra. Since such estimators require require of order N{\_}d{\^{}}3 operations they are computationally prohibitive for N{\_}d greater than a few tens of thousands. Because of this, a large and inhomogeneous literature exists on approximate methods of power spectrum estimation. These range from manifestly sub-optimal, but computationally fast methods, to near optimal but computationally expensive methods. Furthermore, much of this literature concentrates on the power spectrum estimates rather than the equally important problem of deriving an accurate covariance matrix. In this paper, I consider the problem of estimating the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from large data sets. Various analytic results on power spectrum estimators are derived, or collated from the literature, and tested against numerical simulations. An unbiased hybrid estimator is proposed that combines a maximum likelihood estimator at low multipoles and pseudo-C{\_}$\backslash$ell estimates at high multipoles. The hybrid estimator is computationally fast, nearly optimal over the full range of multipoles, and returns an accurate and nearly diagonal covariance matrix for realistic experimental configurations (provided certain conditions on the noise properties of the experiment are satisfied). It is argued that, in practice, computationally expensive methods that approximate the N{\_}d{\^{}}3 maximum likelihood solution are unlikely to improve on the hybrid estimator, and may actually perform worse. The results presented here can be generalised to CMB polarization and to power spectrum estimation using other types of data, such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing.},

Amongst other things, we cover General Relativity, scalar-tensor, Einstein-{\ae}ther, and Bimetric theories, as well as TeVeS, . f(R), general higher-order theories, Hořava-Lifschitz gravity, Galileons, Ghost Condensates, and models of extra dimensions including Kaluza-Klein, Randall-Sundrum, DGP, and higher co-dimension braneworlds. We also review attempts to construct a Parameterised Post-Friedmannian formalism, that can be used to constrain deviations from General Relativity in cosmology, and that is suitable for comparison with data on the largest scales. These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference tool for researchers and students in cosmology and gravitational physics, as well as a self-contained, comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the subject as a whole. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aims: The Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) onboard the Herschel space telescope has provided confusion limited maps of deep fields at 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m, and 500 $\mu$m, as part of the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES). Unfortunately, due to confusion, only a small fraction of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) can be resolved into individually-detected sources. Our goal is to produce deep galaxy number counts and redshift distributions below the confusion limit at SPIRE wavelengths ({\~{}}20 mJy), which we then use to place strong constraints on the origins of the cosmic infrared background and on models of galaxy evolution. Methods: We individually extracted the bright SPIRE sources ({\textgreater}20 mJy) in the COSMOS field with a method using the positions, the flux densities, and the redshifts of the 24 $\mu$m sources as a prior, and derived the number counts and redshift distributions of the bright SPIRE sources. For fainter SPIRE sources ({\textless}20 mJy), we reconstructed the number counts and the redshift distribution below the confusion limit using the deep 24 $\mu$m catalogs associated with photometric redshift and information provided by the stacking of these sources into the deep SPIRE maps of the GOODS-N and COSMOS fields. Finally, by integrating all these counts, we studied the contribution of the galaxies to the CIB as a function of their flux density and redshift. Results: Through stacking, we managed to reconstruct the source counts per redshift slice down to {\~{}}2 mJy in the three SPIRE bands, which lies about a factor 10 below the 5$\sigma$ confusion limit. Our measurements place tight constraints on source population models. None of the pre-existing models are able to reproduce our results at better than 3-$\sigma$. Finally, we extrapolate our counts to zero flux density in order to derive an estimate of the total contribution of galaxies to the CIB, finding 10.1-2.3+2.6 nW m-2 sr-1, 6.5-1.6+1.7 nW m-2 sr-1, and 2.8-0.8+0.9 nW m-2 sr-1 at 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m, and 500 $\mu$m, respectively. These values agree well with FIRAS absolute measurements, suggesting our number counts and their extrapolation are sufficient to explain the CIB. We find that half of the CIB is emitted at z = 1.04, 1.20, and 1.25, respectively. Finally, combining our results with other works, we estimate the energy budget contained in the CIB between 8 $\mu$m and 1000 $\mu$m: 26-3+7 nW m-2 sr-1.},

We present a model which has a constant equation of state, that is, a ``kinetic'' counterpart of the Ratra-Peebles model of a quintessence field with a potential term. We make clear the structure of the phase plane and show that the quintessential solution is a late-time attractor.

abstract = {Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) measurements, which involve cross-correlating the CMB with the foreground large-scale structure (e.g. galaxies/quasars), have proven to be an interesting probe of dark energy. We show that magnification bias, which is the inevitable modulation of the foreground number counts by gravitational lensing, alters both the shape and amplitude of the observed ISW signal. This is true especially at high redshifts because (1) the intrinsic galaxy-temperature signal diminishes greatly back in the matter dominated era, (2) the lensing efficiency increases with redshift and (3) the number count slope generally steepens with redshift in a magnitude limited sample. At z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2, the magnification-temperature correlation dominates over the intrinsic galaxy-temperature correlation and causes the observed ISW signal to increase with z, despite dark energy subdominance -- a result of the fact that magnification probes structures between the observer and the sources. Ignoring magnification bias can then lead to erroneous conclusions about dark energy. While the lensing modulation opens up an interesting high z window for ISW measurements, high z measurements are not expected to add much new information to low z ones if dark energy is the cosmological constant. This is because lensing introduces significant covariance across redshifts. The most compelling reason to pursue high z ISW measurements is to look for a potential surprise such as early dark energy domination or the signature of modified gravity. We conclude with a discussion of existing measurements, the highest z of which is at the margin of being sensitive to magnification bias. We also develop a formalism which might be of general interest: to predict biases in estimating parameters when certain physical effects are ignored in interpreting data.},

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the intervening large-scale structure of the Universe induces high-order correlations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fields. We construct minimum variance estimators of the intervening mass distribution out of the six quadratic combinations of the temperature and polarization fields. Polarization begins to assist in the reconstruction when E-mode mapping becomes possible on degree-scale fields, i.e. for an experiment with a noise level of {\~{}}40 uK-arcmin and beam of {\~{}}7', similar to the Planck experiment; surpasses the temperature reconstruction at {\~{}}26 uK-arcmin and 4'; yet continues to improve the reconstruction until the lensing B-modes are mapped to l {\~{}} 2000 at {\~{}}0.3 uK-arcmin and 3'. Ultimately, the correlation between the E and B modes can provide a high signal-to-noise mass map out to multipoles of L {\~{}} 1000, extending the range of temperature-based estimators by nearly an order of magnitude. We outline four applications of mass reconstruction: measurement of the linear power spectrum in projection to the cosmic variance limit out to L {\~{}} 1000 (or wavenumbers 0.002 {\textless} k {\textless} 0.2 in h/Mpc), cross-correlation with cosmic shear surveys to probe the evolution of structure tomographically, cross-correlation of the mass and temperature maps to probe the dark energy, and the separation of lensing and gravitational wave B-modes.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing of the microwave background by the intervening dark matter mainly arises from large-angle fluctuations in the projected gravitational potential and hence offers a unique opportunity to study the physics of the dark sector at large scales. Studies with surveys that cover greater than a percent of the sky will require techniques that incorporate the curvature of the sky. We lay the groundwork for these studies by deriving the full sky minimum variance quadratic estimators of the lensing potential from the CMB temperature and polarization fields. We also present a general technique for constructing these estimators, with harmonic space convolutions replaced by real space products, that is appropriate for both the full sky limit and the flat sky approximation. This also extends previous treatments to include estimators involving the temperature-polarization cross-correlation and should be useful for next generation experiments in which most of the additional information from polarization comes from this channel due to sensitivity limitations.},

abstract = {Cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, but can be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticity correlations of the source galaxies. The intrinsic alignments are believed to be small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing distortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the tidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby galaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant galaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic-alignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to the tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as suggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a gravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that remains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second model, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation. In the first model, and assuming a normalization consistent with recently claimed detections of intrinsic correlations, we find that the GI correlation term can exceed the usual II term by {\textgreater}1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic correlation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. These interference effects can suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by of order ˜10{\%} at zs=1 and ˜30{\%} at zs=0.5. We conclude that, depending on the intrinsic-alignment model, the GI correlation may be the dominant contaminant of the lensing signal and can even affect cross spectra between widely separated bins. We describe two ways to constrain this effect, one based on density-shear correlations and one based on scaling of the cross correlation tomography signal with redshift.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Seljak2000,
abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute nonlinear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter halos, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations betwen the halos and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. Galaxy power spectrum differs from dark matter power spectrum because pair weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters. In this case the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with the slope closed to the observed. Such a model also predicts a later onset of nonlinear clustering compared to the dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the CDM models with the data. Generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale dependent and nonmonotonic. For red or elliptical galaxies bias in power spectrum may be scale dependent even on very large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through the galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger halos host more than one galaxy. We discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum (ABRIDGED).},

abstract = {The next generation of CMB experiments should get a better handle on cosmological parameters by mapping the weak lensing deflection field, which is separable from primary anisotropies thanks to the non-Gaussianity induced by lensing. However, the generation of perturbations in the Early Universe also produces a level of non-Gaussianity which is known to be small, but can contribute to the anisotropy trispectrum at the same level as lensing. In this work, we study whether the primordial non-Gaussianity can mask the lensing statistics. We concentrate only on the ``temperature quadratic estimator'' of lensing, which will be nearly optimal for the Planck satellite, and work in the flat-sky approximation. We find that primordial non-Gaussianity contaminates the deflection field estimator by roughly (0.1 f{\_}NL){\%} at large angular scales, which represents at most a 10{\%} contribution, not sufficient to threaten lensing extraction, but enough to be taken into account.},

We perform a detailed study of bias in the measurement due to noise, foregrounds, and other effects and determine that these contributions are relatively small compared to the statistical uncertainty in the measurement. We combine this lensing measurement with results from WMAP7 to improve constraints on cosmological parameters when compared to those from WMAP7 alone: we find a factor of 3.9 improvement in the measurement of the spatial curvature of the Universe, Omega{\_}k=-0.0014+/-0.0172; a 10{\%} improvement in the amplitude of matter fluctuations within LCDM, sigma{\_}8=0.810+/ 0.026; and a 5{\%} improvement in the dark energy equation of state, w=-1.04+/-0.40.

abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the CMB on arcminute scales. Measurements of this effect can be used to constrain the masses of galaxy clusters with CMB data alone. Here we present a measurement of lensing of the CMB by galaxy clusters using data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). We develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the CMB cluster lensing signal and validate the method on mock data. We quantify the effects on our analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find that they generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. It is estimated that this bias to lower cluster mass is roughly {\$}0.85\backslashsigma{\$} in units of the statistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upper limit. We apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected via their SZ signatures in SPT data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensing at {\$}3.1\backslashsigma{\$}.

abstract = {We present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by the variation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground large scale structure. To make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees of photometric observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) containing $\backslash${\~{}}200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. Our measurement of the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence and change in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number counts that is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. We show that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, Galactic dust extinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are well controlled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. By weighting the quasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation of quasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at {\textgreater}4 sigma in all five SDSS filters. Our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scales ranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 Mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the WMAP concordance cosmology. As with galaxy-galaxy lensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide useful constraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.},

abstract = {We present Spin-SILC, a new foreground component separation method that accurately extracts the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation {\$}E{\$} and {\$}B{\$} modes from raw multifrequency Stokes {\$}Q{\$} and {\$}U{\$} measurements of the microwave sky. Spin-SILC is an internal linear combination method that uses spin wavelets to analyse the spin-2 polarisation signal {\$}P = Q + iU{\$}. The wavelets are additionally directional (non-axisymmetric). This allows different morphologies of signals to be separated and therefore the cleaning algorithm is localised using an additional domain of information. The advantage of spin wavelets over standard scalar wavelets is to simultaneously and self-consistently probe scales and directions in the polarisation signal {\$}P = Q + iU{\$} and in the underlying {\$}E{\$} and {\$}B{\$} modes, therefore providing the ability to perform component separation and {\$}E{\$}-{\$}B{\$} decomposition concurrently for the first time. We test Spin-SILC on full-mission Planck simulations and data and show the capacity to correctly recover the underlying cosmological {\$}E{\$} and {\$}B{\$} modes. We also demonstrate a strong consistency of our CMB maps with those derived from existing component separation methods. Spin-SILC can be combined with the pseudo- and pure {\$}E{\$}-{\$}B{\$} spin wavelet estimators presented in a companion paper to reliably extract the cosmological signal in the presence of complicated sky cuts and noise. Therefore, it will provide a computationally-efficient method to accurately extract the CMB {\$}E{\$} and {\$}B{\$} modes for future polarisation experiments.},

abstract = {Early reionization changes the pattern of anisotropies expected in the cosmic microwave background. To explore these changes, we derive from first principles the equations governing anisotropies, focusing on the interactions of photons with electrons. Vishniac (1987) claimed that second order terms can be large in a re-ionized Universe, so we derive equations correct to second order in the perturbations. There are many more second order terms than were considered by Vishniac. To understand the basic physics involved, we present a simple analytic approximation to the first order equation. Then turning to the sec- ond order equation, we show that the Vishniac term is indeed the only important one. We also present numerical results for a variety of ionization histories [in a standard cold dark matter Universe] and show quantitatively how the sig- nal in several experiments depends on the ionization history. The most pronounced indication of a re-ionized Universe would be seen in very small scale experiments; the expected signal in the Owens Valley experiment is smaller by a factor of order ten if the last scattering surface is at a redshift {\$}z\backslashsimeq100{\$} as it would be if the Universe were re-ionized very early. On slightly larger scales, the expected signal in a re-ionized Universe {\{}$\backslash$it is{\}} smaller than it would be with standard recombination, but only by a factor of two or so.},

We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of non-linear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the non-linear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.},

abstract = {The multi-frequency capability of the Planck satellite provides information both on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infrared background, or CIB) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensing effect on the cosmic microwave background, or CMB). The conjunction of these two unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark and luminous matter in the high redshift (1 {\textless} z {\textless}3) Universe. We use a three-point statistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers. Following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite of consistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 GHz and CIB measurements at 100-857 GHz, we report the first detection of the correlation between the CIB and CMB lensing. The well matched redshift distribution of these two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42 $\backslash$sigma at 545 GHz and a correlation as high as 80{\%} across these two tracers. Our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both CIB auto- and CIB-lensing cross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with a characteristic mass scale for the halos hosting CIB sources of log{\_}{\{}10{\}}(M/M{\_}sun) = 10.5 $\backslash$pm 0.6. Leveraging the frequency dependence of our signal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the CIB, and constrain the star formation rate (SFR) density at z{\textgreater}1. We measure directly the SFR density with around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7, thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at early times.},

The implementation of an Internal Linear Combination method locally in both pixel and harmonic space, with the use of a decomposition of WMAP maps onto a frame of spherical needlets, permits to extract a full sky CMB map, with good accuracy even in regions close to the galactic plane. Proper subtraction of this estimated CMB from WMAP original observations provides us with CMB-free foreground maps, which can be used for the analysis of the emission of the galactic interstellar medium and for detecting and measuring emissions from compact sources. Finally, while the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cannot be detected for individual clusters in WMAP data, due to lack of spatial resolution and sensitivity, a stacking analysis of tentative detections towards a number of known ROSAT clusters permits to detect the SZ effect in WMAP data and measure how the SZ flux scales with cluster mass and X-ray luminosity.},

This approach is equivalent at lowest order in scattering kinematics to classical radiative transfer, and provides a general framework for treating the cosmological evolution of density matrices. The metric perturbations are treated in the physically appealing longitudinal gauge. Expressions for various temperature and polarization correlation functions are derived.

abstract = {This is the dawning of the age of precision cosmology, when all the important parameters will be established to one significant figure or better, within the cosmological model. In the age of accurate cosmology the model, which nowadays includes general relativity theory and the CDM model for structure formation, will be checked tightly enough to be established as a convincing approximation to reality. I comment on how we might make the transition. We already have some serious tests of gravity physics on the length and time scales of cosmology. The evidence for consistency with general relativity theory is still rough, but impressive, considering the enormous extrapolation from the empirical basis, and these probes of gravity physics will be considerably improved by work in progress on the cosmological tests. The CDM model has some impressive observational successes too, and some challenges, not least of which is that the model is based on a wonderfully optimistic view of the simplicity of physics in the dark sector. I present as a cautionary example a model for dark matter and dark energy that biases interpretations of cosmological observations that assume the CDM model. In short, cosmology has become an empirically rich subject with a well-motivated standard model, but it needs work to be established as generally accurate.},

abstract = {Correlations of galaxy ellipticities with large-scale structure, due to galactic tidal interactions, provide a potentially significant contaminant to measurements of cosmic shear. However, these intrinsic alignments are still poorly understood for galaxies at the redshifts typically used in cosmic shear analyses. For spiral galaxies, it is thought that tidal torquing is significant in determining alignments resulting in zero correlation between the intrinsic ellipticity and the gravitational potential in linear theory. Here, we calculate the leading-order correction to this result in the tidal-torque model from non-linear evolution, using second-order perturbation theory, and relate this to the contamination from intrinsic alignments to the recently-measured cross-correlation between galaxy ellipticities and the CMB lensing potential. We find that the angular cross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in the linear alignment model (believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies), but the opposite sign and so increases the observable correlation between CMB lensing and spiral galaxies. The amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the formation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift when the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller. Finally, we make simple forecasts for constraints on intrinsic alignments from the correlation of forthcoming cosmic shear measurements with current CMB lensing measurements.},

All kSZ measurements to date have explicitly required spectroscopic redshifts. Here, we implement a novel estimator for the kSZ -- large-scale structure cross-correlation based on projected fields: it does not require redshift estimates for individual objects, allowing kSZ measurements from large-scale imaging surveys. We apply this estimator to cleaned CMB temperature maps constructed from Planck and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data and a galaxy sample from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We measure the kSZ effect at 3.8-4.5{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} significance, depending on the use of additional WISE galaxy bias constraints. We verify that our measurements are robust to possible dust emission from the WISE galaxies. Assuming the standard {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology, we directly constrain {\$}( {\{}f{\_}{\{}b{\}}{\}}/{\{}0.158{\}} ) ( {\{}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm free{\}}{\}}/{\{}1.0{\}} ) = 1.48 \backslashpm 0.19{\$} (statistical error only) at redshift {\$}z \backslashapprox 0.4{\$}, where {\$}f{\_}{\{}b{\}}{\$} is the fraction of matter in baryonic form and {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm free{\}}{\$} is the free electron fraction. This is the tightest kSZ-derived constraint reported to date on these parameters. The consistency between the {\$}f{\_}{\{}b{\}}{\$} value found here and the values inferred from analyses of the primordial CMB and Big Bang nucleosynthesis verifies that baryons approximately trace the dark matter distribution down to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}Mpc scales. While our projected-field estimator is already competitive with other kSZ approaches when applied to current datasets (because we are able to use the full-sky WISE photometric survey), it will yield enormous signal-to-noise when applied to upcoming high-resolution, multi-frequency CMB surveys.},

Small-scale CMB fluctuations are a mixture of late-time effects: gravitational lensing, Doppler shifting of CMB photons by moving electrons (the kSZ effect), and residual foregrounds.

The decomposition extends to high redshift, and does not require external datasets such as galaxy surveys. In particular, the high-redshift signal from patchy reionization can be cleanly isolated, enabling future CMB experiments to make high-significance and qualitatively new measurements of the reionization era.},

abstract = {Far-infrared and submillimeter wavelength surveys have now established the important role of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the assembly of stellar mass and the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. The brightest of these galaxies have infrared luminosities in excess of 1013L??? with implied star-formation rates of thousands of solar masses per year. They represent the most intense starbursts in the Universe, yet many are completely optically obscured. Their easy detection at submm wavelengths is due to dust heated by ultraviolet radiation of newly forming stars. When summed up, all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an infrared radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight emission from all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The bulk of this infrared extragalactic background light emanates from galaxies as diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting galaxies. Major advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both space-based and ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our understanding of the underlying astrophysics that govern the start and end of the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage. This review is aimed at summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the detailed characterization of the best-understood subset (submillimeter galaxies, who were summarized in the last review of this field over a decade ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization of more recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics, their physical properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their environments, and current theoretical models related to the formation and evolution of these galaxies. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We study the implications of Planck data for models of dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG), beyond the cosmological constant scenario. We start with cases where the DE only directly affects the background evolution, considering Taylor expansions of the equation of state, principal component analysis and parameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar field. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly improve present constraints. We then move to general parameterizations of the DE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the phenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range of specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and coupled DE. In addition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use baryonic acoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble constant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological perturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational lensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and for breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck and background data sets. All results that include only background parameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When testing models that also change perturbations (even when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions appear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is $\backslash$sim 2 sigma for Planck TT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials with a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma when external data sets are included. It however disappears when including CMB lensing.},

abstract = {Secondary CMB anisotropies and polarization provide a laboratory to study structure formation in the reionized epoch. We consider the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from mildly nonlinear large-scale structure and show that it is a natural extension of the perturbative Vishniac effect. If the gas traces the dark matter to overdensities of order 10, as expected from simulations, this effect is at least comparable to the Vishniac effect at arcminute scales. On smaller scales, it may be used to study the thermal history-dependent clustering of the gas. Polarization is generated through Thomson scattering of primordial quadrupole anisotropies, kinetic (second order Doppler) quadrupole anisotropies and intrinsic scattering quadrupole anisotropies. Small scale polarization results from the density and ionization modulation of these sources. These effects generically produce comparable E and B-parity polarization, but of negligible amplitude (0.001-0.01 uK) in adiabatic CDM models. However, the primordial and kinetic quadrupoles are observationally comparable today so that a null detection of B-polarization would set constraints on the evolution and coherence of the velocity field. Conversely, a detection of a cosmological B-polarization even at large angles does not necessarily imply the presence of gravity waves or vorticity. For these calculations, we develop an all-sky generalization of the Limber equation that allows for an arbitrary local angular dependence of the source for both scalar and symmetric trace-free tensor fields on the sky.},

abstract = {The Planck full mission cosmic microwave background(CMB) temperature and E-mode polarization maps are analysed to obtain constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity(NG). Using three classes of optimal bispectrum estimators - separable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and modal - we obtain consistent values for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result from temperature alone fNL{\^{}}local=2.5+$\backslash$-5.7, fNL{\^{}}equil=-16+$\backslash$-70 and fNL{\^{}}ortho=-34+$\backslash$-33(68{\%}CL). Combining temperature and polarization data we obtain fNL{\^{}}local=0.8+$\backslash$-5.0, fNL{\^{}}equil=-4+$\backslash$-43 and fNL{\^{}}ortho=-26+$\backslash$-21 (68{\%}CL). The results are based on cross-validation of these estimators on simulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass an extensive suite of tests, and are consistent with Minkowski functionals based measurements. The effect of time-domain de-glitching systematics on the bispectrum is negligible. In spite of these test outcomes we conservatively label the results including polarization data as preliminary, due to a known mismatch of the noise model in simulations and the data. Beyond fNL estimates, we present model-independent reconstructions of the CMB bispectrum and derive constraints on early universe scenarios that generate NG, including general single-field and axion inflation, initial state modifications, parity-violating tensor bispectra, and directionally-dependent vector models. We also present a wide survey of scale-dependent oscillatory bispectra, and we look for isocurvature NG. Our constraint on the local primordial trispectrum amplitude is gNL{\^{}}local=(-9.0+$\backslash$-7.7)x10{\^{}}4 (68{\%}CL), and we perform an analysis of additional trispectrum shapes. The global picture is one of consistency with the premises of the LambdaCDM cosmology, namely that the structure we observe today was sourced by adiabatic, passive, Gaussian, and primordial seed perturbations.[abridged]},

Within this class we vary the amplitude of the field, which controls the range of the enhanced gravitational forces, both at the present epoch and as a function of redshift. Most models in the literature can be mapped onto the parameter space of this class. Focusing on the abundance of massive dark matter halos, we compare the simulation results to a simple spherical collapse model. Current constraints lie in the large-field regime, where the chameleon mechanism is not important. In this regime, the spherical collapse model works equally well for a wide range of models and can serve as a model-independent tool for placing constraints on f(R) gravity from cluster abundance.

abstract = {We report the first detection of the ISW effect in wavelet space, at scales in the sky around 7 degrees with a significance of around 3.3 sigma, by cross-correlating the WMAP first-year data and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). In addition, we present a detailed comparison among the capabilities of three different techniques for two different objectives: to detect the ISW and to put constraints in the nature of the dark energy. The three studied techniques are: the cross-angular power spectrum (CAPS, harmonic space), the correlation function (CCF, real space) and the covariance of the Spherical Mexican Hat Wavelet (SMHW) coefficients (CSMHW, wavelet space). We prove that the CSMHW is expected to provide a higher detection of the ISW effect for a certain scale. This prediction has been corroborated by the analysis of the data. The SMHW analysis shows that the cross-correlation signal is caused neither by systematic effects nor foreground contamination. However, by taking into account the information encoded in all the multipoles/scales/angles, the CAPS provides slightly better constraints than the SMHW in the cosmological parameters that define the nature of the dark energy. The limits provided by the CCF are wider than for the other two methods. Two different cases have been studied: 1) a flat Lambda-CDM universe and 2) a flat universe with an equation of state parameter different from -1. In the first case, the CAPS provides (for a bias value of b = 1.6) 0.59 {\textless} Lambda density {\textless} 0.84 (at 1 sigma CL). Moreover, the CAPS rejects the range Lambda density {\textless} 0.1 at 3.5 sigma, which is the highest detection of the dark energy reported up to date.

We find the latter more useful for statistical analysis; the distribution of the normalized bispectrum is very much Gaussian, while the bare bispectrum distribution is highly non-Gaussian. Then, we measure 466 modes of the normalized bispectrum, all independent combinations of three-point configurations up to a maximum multipole of 20, the mode corresponding to the DMR beam size. By measuring 10 times as many modes as the sum of previous work, we test the Gaussianity of the DMR maps. We compare the data with the simulated Gaussian realizations, finding no significant detection of the normalized bispectrum on a mode-by-mode basis. We also find that the previously reported detection of the normalized bispectrum is consistent with a statistical fluctuation. By fitting a theoretical prediction to the data for the primordial CMB bispectrum, which is motivated by slow-roll inflation, we put a weak constraint on the parameter characterizing nonlinearity in inflation. Simultaneously fitting the foreground bispectra estimated from interstellar dust and synchrotron template maps shows that neither dust nor synchrotron emission significantly contributes to the bispectrum at high Galactic latitude. We conclude that the DMR map is consistent with Gaussianity.},

abstract = {As the era of high precision cosmology approaches, the empirically determined power spectrum of the microwave background anisotropy Cl will provide a crucial test for cosmological theories. We present an exact semianalytic framework for the study of the sampling statistics of the Cl resulting from observations with partial sky coverage and anisotropic noise distributions. This includes space-borne, air-borne, and ground-based experiments. We apply this theory to demonstrate its power for constructing fast and unbiased approximate methods for the joint estimation of cosmological parameters. Further applications, such as a test for possible non-Gaussianity of the underlying theory and a ``poor man's power spectrum estimator'' are suggested. An appendix derives recursion relations for the efficient computation of the couplings between spherical harmonics on the cut sky.},

Foreground cleaning is implemented using minimum variance linear combinations of the coefficients of needlet decompositions of sky maps for all WMAP channels, to produce maps for CMB temperature anisotropies (T-mode) and polarisation (E-mode and B-mode), for 9 different years of observation. The final power spectra are computed from averages of all possible cross-year power spectra obtained using foreground-cleaned maps for the different years. Our analysis technique yields a measurement of the EE spectrum that is in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations from the current cosmological model. By comparison, the publicly available WMAP EE power spectrum is higher on average (and significantly higher than the predicted EE spectrum from the current best fit) at scales larger than about a degree, an excess that is not confirmed by our analysis.},

The reduced moments (cumulants) of the density distribution are computed and used to obtain a series expansion for the density distribution function. Analytic results are obtained for the density distribution function in the case of a distribution of seed masses with a spherical top-hat accretion pattern.

ACT measures fluctuations at scales 500{\textless}l{\textless}10000. We fit a model for the lensed CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and foreground contribution to the 148 GHz and 218 GHz power spectra, including thermal and kinetic SZ, Poisson power from radio and infrared point sources, and clustered power from infrared point sources. The power from thermal and kinetic SZ at 148 GHz is estimated to be B{\_}3000 = 6.8+-2.9 uK{\^{}}2, where B{\_}l=l(l+1)C{\_}l/2pi. We estimate primary cosmological parameters from the 148 GHz spectrum, marginalizing over SZ and source power. The LCDM cosmological model is a good fit to the data, and LCDM parameters estimated from ACT+WMAP are consistent with the 7-year WMAP limits, with scale invariant n{\_}s = 1 excluded at 99.7{\%} CL (3sigma). A model with no CMB lensing is disfavored at 2.8sigma. By measuring the third to seventh acoustic peaks, and probing the Silk damping regime, the ACT data improve limits on cosmological parameters that affect the small-scale CMB power. The ACT data combined with WMAP give a 6sigma detection of primordial helium, with Y{\_}P = 0.313+-0.044, and a 4sigma detection of relativistic species, assumed to be neutrinos, with Neff = 5.3+-1.3 (4.6+-0.8 with BAO+H0 data). From the CMB alone the running of the spectral index is constrained to be dn/dlnk = -0.034 +- 0.018, the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r{\textless}0.25 (95{\%} CL), and the possible contribution of Nambu cosmic strings to the power spectrum is constrained to string tension Gmu{\textless}1.6 $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}-7 (95{\%} CL).},

abstract = {We cross-correlate a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing map with the projected space densities of quasars to measure the bias and halo masses of a quasar sample split into obscured and unobscured populations, the first application of this method to distinct quasar subclasses. Several recent studies of the angular clustering of obscured quasars have shown that these objects likely reside in higher-mass halos compared to their unobscured counterparts. This has important implications for models of the structure and geometry of quasars, their role in growing supermassive black holes, and mutual quasar/host galaxy evolution. However, the magnitude and significance of this difference has varied from study to study. Using data from $\backslash$planck, $\backslash$wise, and SDSS, we follow up on these results using the independent method of CMB lensing cross-correlations. The region and sample are identical to that used for recent angular clustering measurements, allowing for a direct comparison of the CMB-lensing and angular clustering methods. At {\$}z \backslashsim 1{\$}, we find that the bias of obscured quasars is {\$}b{\_}q = 2.57 \backslashpm 0.24{\$}, while that of unobscured quasars is {\$}b{\_}q = 1.89 \backslashpm 0.19{\$}. This corresponds to halo masses of {\$}\backslashlog (M{\_}h / M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) = 13.24{\_}{\{}-0.15{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.14{\}}{\$} (obscured) and {\$}\backslashlog (M{\_}h / M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) = 12.71{\_}{\{}-0.13{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.15{\}}{\$} (unobscured). These results agree well with with those from angular clustering (well within {\$}1\backslashsigma{\$}), and confirm that obscured quasars reside in host halos {\$}\backslashsim{\$}3 times as massive as halos hosting unobscured quasars. This implies that quasars spend a significant portion of their lifetime in an obscured state, possibly more than one half of the entire active phase.},

(2) It is quadratic, which makes the statistical properties of the measurements easy to compute and use for estimation of cosmological parameters. (3) It is computationally faster than rival high-precision methods such as the nonlinear maximum-likelihood technique, with the crucial steps scaling as n{\^{}}2 rather than n{\^{}}3, where n is the number of map pixels. (4) It is applicable to any survey geometry whatsoever, with arbitraty regions masked out and arbitrary noise behaviour. (5) It is not a "black-box" method, but quite simple to understand intuitively: it corresponds to a high-pass filtering and edge softening of the original map followed by a straight expansion in truncated spherical-harmonics. It is argued that this method is computationally feasible even for futute high-resolution CMB experiments with n=10{\^{}}6-10{\^{}}7. It is also shown that C{\_}l computed with this method is useful not merely for graphical presentation purposes, but also as an intermediate (and arguably necessary) step in the data analysis pipeline, reducing the data set to a more manageable size before the final step of constraining Gaussian cosmological models and parameters - while retaining all the cosmological information that was present in the original map.},

This idea is based on the Copernican Principle, that we are not at a particularly special place in the universe. Surprisingly, this philosophical assumption has yet to be rigorously demonstrated independently of the standard paradigm. This issue has been brought to light by cosmological models which can potentially explain apparent acceleration by spatial inhomogeneity rather than dark energy. These models replace the temporal fine tuning associated with Lambda with a spatial fine tuning, and so violate the Copernican assumption. While is seems unlikely that such models can really give a realistic solution to the dark energy problem, they do reveal how poorly constrained radial inhomogeneity actually is. So the bigger issue remains: How do we robustly test the Copernican Principle independently of dark energy or theory of gravity?. ?? 2012.},

Computing the lensed power spectra to first order in the deflection power requires one to formulate the lensing displacement beyond the tangent-space approximation. We point out that for CMB polarization this displacement must undergo geometric corrections on the spherical sky to maintain statistical isotropy of the lensed fields. Although not discussed by Hu, these geometric effects are implicit in his analysis. However, there they are hidden by an overly-compact notation that is both unconventional and rather confusing. Here we aim to ameliorate this deficiency by providing a rigorous derivation of the lensed spherical power spectra.},

abstract = {Galaxy shapes are subject to distortions due to the tidal field of the Universe. The cross-correlation of galaxy lensing with the lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) cannot easily be separated from the cross-correlation of galaxy intrinsic shapes with CMB lensing. Previous work suggested that the intrinsic alignment contamination can be {\$}15\backslash{\%}{\$} of this cross-spectrum for the CFHT Stripe 82 (CS82) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope surveys. Here we re-examine these estimates using up-to-date observational constraints of intrinsic alignments at a redshift more similar to that of CS82 galaxies. We find a {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} {\$}10\backslash{\%}{\$} contamination of the cross-spectrum from red galaxies, with {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} {\$}3\backslash{\%}{\$} uncertainty due to uncertainties in the redshift distribution of source galaxies and the modelling of the spectral energy distribution. Blue galaxies are consistent with being unaligned, but could contaminate the cross-spectrum by an additional {\$}9.5\backslash{\%}{\$} within current {\$}95\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence levels. While our fiducial estimate of alignment contamination is similar to previous work, our work suggests that the relevance of alignments for CMB lensing-galaxy lensing cross-correlation remains largely unconstrained. Little information is currently available about alignments at {\$}z{\textgreater}1.2{\$}. We consider the upper limiting case where all {\$}z{\textgreater}1.2{\$} galaxies are aligned with the same strength as low redshift luminous red galaxies, finding as much as {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} {\$}60\backslash{\%}{\$} contamination.},

Temperature maps are analyzed by expanding over the set of spherical harmonics to give multipole moments of the two-point correlation function. Polarization, which is described by a second-rank tensor, can be treated analogously by expanding in the appropriate tensor spherical harmonics. We provide expressions for the complete set of temperature and polarization multipole moments for scalar and tensor metric perturbations. Four sets of multipole moments completely describe isotropic temperature and polarization correlations; for scalar metric perturbations one set is identically zero, giving the possibility of a clean determination of the vector and tensor contributions. The variance with which the multipole moments can be measured in idealized experiments is evaluated, including the effects of detector noise, sky coverage, and beam width. Finally, we construct coordinate-independent polarization two-point correlation functions, express them in terms of the multipole moments, and derive small-angle limits.},

Of the 6621 250 $\mu$m {\textgreater} 32-mJy sources in our science demonstration catalogue we find that ˜60 per cent have counterparts brighter than r = 22.4 mag in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Applying a likelihood ratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with a reliability R {\textgreater} 0.8. This is approximately 37 per cent of the full 250-$\mu$m catalogue. We have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423 reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collated from several different sources, including the GAMA survey. We estimate the completeness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and present evidence that 250-$\mu$m-selected Herschel-ATLAS galaxies have a bimodal redshift distribution. Those with reliable optical identifications have a redshift distribution peaking at z ≈ 0.25 ± 0.05, while submillimetre colours suggest that a significant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z {\textgreater} 1. We also suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Our identifications are matched to UV-NIR photometry from the GAMA survey, and these data are available as part of the Herschel-ATLAS public data release.

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is one of the key probes of cosmology. Cosmic shear surveys aimed at measuring the distribution of matter in the universe are currently being carried out (Pan-STARRS) or planned for the coming decade (DES, LSST, EUCLID, WFIRST). Crucial to the success of these surveys is the control of systematics. In this work, a new method to constrain one such family of systematics, known as multiplicative bias, is proposed. This method exploits the cross-correlation between weak-lensing measurements from galaxy surveys and the ones obtained from high-resolution cosmic microwave background experiments. This cross-correlation is shown to have the power to break the degeneracy between the normalization of the matter power spectrum and the multiplicative bias of cosmic shear and to be able to constrain the latter to a few percent.},

abstract = {We compare various star formation rate (SFR) indicators for star-forming galaxies at 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 in the COSMOS field. The main focus is on the SFRs from the far-IR (PACS-Herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxies selected according to the BzK criterion. FIR-selected samples lead to a vastly different slope of the SFR-stellar mass (M*) relation, compared to that of the dominant main-sequence population as measured from the UV, since the FIR selection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. However, there is overall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two SFR indicators, when stacking on the PACS maps the BzK-selected galaxies. The resulting logarithmic slope of the SFR-M* relation is ˜0.8-0.9, in agreement with that derived from the dust-corrected UV luminosity. Exploiting deeper 24 $\mu$m Spitzer data, we have characterized a subsample of galaxies with reddening and SFRs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the B band. The combination of Herschel with Spitzer data has allowed us to largely break the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, by distinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in B-z because of being heavily dust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being) quenched. Finally, we have compared our SFR(UV) to the SFRs derived by stacking the radio data and to those derived from the H$\alpha$ luminosity of a sample of star-forming galaxies at 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.7. The two sets of SFRs are broadly consistent as they are with the SFRs derived from the UV and by stacking the corresponding PACS data in various mass bins.},

We demonstrate that our results are not biased by instrumental and astrophysical systematic errors by performing null tests, checks with simulated and real data, and analytical calculations.

abstract = {[abridged] We investigate the coevolution of galaxies and hosted supermassive black holes throughout the history of the Universe by a statistical approach based on the continuity equation and the abundance matching technique. Specifically, we present analytical solutions of the continuity equation without source term to reconstruct the supermassive black hole (BH) mass function from the AGN luminosity functions. Such an approach includes physically-motivated AGN lightcurves tested on independent datasets, which describe the evolution of the Eddington ratio and radiative efficiency from slim- to thin-disc conditions. We nicely reproduce the local estimates of the BH mass function, the AGN duty cycle as a function of mass and redshift, along with the Eddington ratio function and the fraction of galaxies with given stellar mass hosting an AGN with given Eddington ratio. We exploit the same approach to reconstruct the observed stellar mass function at different redshift from the UV and far-IR luminosity functions associated to star formation in galaxies. These results imply that the buildup of stars and BHs in galaxies occurs via in-situ processes, with dry mergers playing a marginal role at least for stellar masses {\textless} 3 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun and BH masses {\textless} 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun, where the statistical data are more secure and less biased by systematic errors. In addition, we develop an improved abundance matching technique to link the stellar and BH content of galaxies to the gravitationally dominant dark matter component. The resulting relationships constitute a testbed for galaxy evolution models, highlighting the complementary role of stellar and AGN feedback in the star formation process. Finally, the clustering properties of BHs and galaxies are found to be in full agreement with current observations, so further validating our results from the continuity equation.},

Studying the alignment of galaxies can therefore deliver important information about the physics of galaxy formation and evolution as well as the growth of structure in the Universe. In this review paper we summarise key measurements of galaxy alignments, divided by galaxy type, scale and environment. We also cover the statistics and formalism necessary to understand the observations in the literature. With the emergence of weak gravitational lensing as a precision probe of cosmology, galaxy alignments have taken on an added importance because they can mimic cosmic shear, the effect of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure on observed galaxy shapes. This makes galaxy alignments, commonly referred to as intrinsic alignments, an important systematic effect in weak lensing studies. We quantify the impact of intrinsic alignments on cosmic shear surveys and finish by reviewing practical mitigation techniques which attempt to remove contamination by intrinsic alignments.},

The lensing potential can be quadratically estimated from CMB temperature and/or polarization maps. We show that the cross-correlation can be measured with high signal-to-noise ratio with data from the Planck Surveyor. We discuss how such a measurement can be used to understand the nature of FIRB sources and their relation to the distribution of dark matter.},

abstract = {We present a new measurement of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Using 600 square degrees of overlapping sky area, we evaluate the mean pairwise baryon momentum associated with the positions of 50,000 bright galaxies in the BOSS DR11 Large Scale Structure catalog. A non-zero signal arises from the large-scale motions of halos containing the sample galaxies. The data fits an analytical signal model well, with the optical depth to microwave photon scattering as a free parameter determining the overall signal amplitude. We estimate the covariance matrix of the mean pairwise momentum as a function of galaxy separation, using microwave sky simulations, jackknife evaluation, and bootstrap estimates. The most conservative simulation-based errors give signal-to-noise estimates between 3.6 and 4.1 for varying galaxy luminosity cuts. We discuss how the other error determinations can lead to higher signal-to-noise values, and consider the impact of several possible systematic errors. Estimates of the optical depth from the average thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal at the sample galaxy positions are broadly consistent with those obtained from the mean pairwise momentum signal.},

abstract = {Measurement of the gas velocity distribution in galaxy clusters provides insight into the physics of mergers, through which large scale structures form in the Universe. Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be obtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is challenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic effects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report resolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple merger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM 30m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal (tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we extract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The kSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and +3.4 sigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us and coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a major merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight velocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters. Combining NIKA data with X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra, we fit this model to constrain the gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the first time, a velocity map from kSZ data (i.e. that is model-dependent). Our results are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and thanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the structure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination and systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter galaxies. Among the sources that we detect with NIKA, we find one which is likely to be a high redshift lensed submillimeter galaxy.},

@article{Chabrier2003,
abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\~{}}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\~{}}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma${\~{}}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\~{}}0.2 Msolar and $\sigma${\~{}}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\~{}}n*{\~{}}0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\~{}}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\~{}}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\~{}}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'{e}}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability. The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

abstract = {The CMB bispectrum is a potential window on exciting new physics, as it is sensitive to the non-Gaussian features in the primordial fluctuations, the same fluctuations that evolved into today's planets, stars and galaxies. However, this invaluable information is potentially screened, as not all of the observed non-Gaussianity is of primordial origin. Indeed, a bispectrum arises even for perfectly Gaussian initial conditions due to non-linear dynamics, such as CMB photons scattering off free electrons and propagating in an inhomogeneous Universe. In this thesis, I introduce the reader to this intrinsic bispectrum in a pedagogic way, building up from the standard model of cosmology and from cosmological perturbation theory, the tool cosmologists use to unravel the history of the cosmos. In doing so, I introduce {\$}\backslashhref{\{}https://github.com/coccoinomane/song{\}}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}SONG{\}}{\}}{\$}, a new and efficient code for solving the second-order Einstein and Boltzmann equations. Next, I move on to answer the crucial question: is the intrinsic bispectrum going to screen the primordial signal in the CMB? Using {\$}\backslashhref{\{}https://github.com/coccoinomane/song{\}}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}SONG{\}}{\}}{\$}, I compute the intrinsic bispectrum and shows how its contamination leads to a small bias in the estimates of primordial non-Gaussianity, a great news for the prospect of using CMB data to probe primordial non-Gaussianity.},

abstract = {The cosmic expansion history tests the dynamics of the global evolution of the universe and its energy density contents, while the cosmic growth history tests the evolution of the inhomogeneous part of the energy density. Precision comparison of the two histories can distinguish the nature of the physics responsible for the accelerating cosmic expansion: an additional smooth component - dark energy - or a modification of the gravitational field equations. With the aid of a new fitting formula for linear perturbation growth accurate to 0.05-0.2{\%}, we separate out the growth dependence on the expansion history and introduce a new growth index parameter $\backslash$gamma that quantifies the gravitational modification.},

abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z {\~{}} 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations ({\~{}}0.1 dex 1$\sigma$ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is {\~{}}0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 ± 0.02 - 0.026 ± 0.003 × t)log M * - (6.51 ± 0.24 - 0.11 ± 0.03 × t), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-$\tau$ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1$\sigma$ spread in formation times of {\~{}}1.4 Gyr.},

Directional wavelets, when convolved with signals on the sphere, can separate the anisotropic filamentary structures which are characteristic of both the CMB and foregrounds. Extending previous component separation methods, which use the frequency, spatial and harmonic signatures of foregrounds to separate them from the cosmological background signal, SILC can additionally use morphological information in the foregrounds and CMB to better localise the cleaning algorithm. We test the method on Planck data and simulations, demonstrating consistency with existing component separation algorithms, and discuss how to optimise the use of morphological information by varying the number of directional wavelets as a function of spatial scale. We find that combining the use of directional and axisymmetric wavelets depending on scale could yield higher quality CMB temperature maps. Our results set the stage for the application of SILC to polarisation anisotropies through an extension to spin wavelets.},

We compare the recovered signal with the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM prediction, on the whole interval of angular scales which is allowed by the finite box size, extending from the degree scale to the arcminute, by applying a quadratic estimator in the flat sky limit; we consider PRISM-like instrumental specification for future generation CMB satellites, corresponding to arcminute angular resolution of 3.2' and sensitivity of 2.43 {\$}{\{}\backslashmu{\}}{\$}K-arcmin. -arcmin. The noise bias in the simulations closely follows the estimator prediction, becoming dominated by limits in the angular resolution for the EB signal, at l{\$}{\{}\backslashsimeq{\}}{\$}1500. The de-biased signal shows no visible departure from predictions of the weak lensing power within uncertainties, when considering TT and EB data singularly. In particular, the reconstruction precision reaches the level of a few percent in bins with {\$}\backslashDelta{\$}l {\$}{\{}\backslashsimeq{\}}{\$}100 in the angular multiple interval 1000{\textless}l{\textless}2000 for TT, and about 10{\$}{\%}{\$} for EB. Within the adopted specifications, polarisation data do represent a significant contribution to the lensing shear, which appear to faithfully trace the underlying N-body structure down to the smallest angular scales achievable with the present setup, validating at the same time the latter with respect to semi-analytical predictions from {\$}{\{}\backslashLambda{\}}{\$}CDM cosmology at the level of CMB lensing statistics. This work demonstrates the feasibility of CMB lensing studies based on large scale simulations of cosmological structure formation in the context of the current and future high resolution and sensitivity CMB experiment.},

abstract = {Upon its completion the Herschel ATLAS (H-ATLAS) will be the largest submillimetre survey to date, detecting close to half-a-million sources. It will only be possible to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of these sources. However, if the rest-frame spectral energy distribution (SED) of a typical H-ATLAS source is known, this SED and the observed Herschel fluxes can be used to estimate the redshifts of the H-ATLAS sources without spectroscopic redshifts. In this paper, we use a subset of 40 H-ATLAS sources with previously measured redshifts in the range 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}4.2 to derive a suitable average template for high redshift H-ATLAS sources. We find that a template with two dust components T{\_}c = 23.9 K, T{\_}h = 46.9 K and ratio of mass of cold dust to mass of warm dust of 30.1) provides a good fit to the rest-frame fluxes of the sources in our calibration sample. We use a jackknife technique to estimate the accuracy of the redshifts estimated with this template, finding a root mean square of Delta z/(1+z) = 0.26. For sources for which there is prior information that they lie at z {\textgreater} 1 we estimate that the rms of Delta z/(1+z) = 0.12. We have used this template to estimate the redshift distribution for the sources detected in the H-ATLAS equatorial fields, finding a bimodal distribution with a mean redshift of 1.2, 1.9 and 2.5 for 250, 350 and 500 um selected sources respectively. $\backslash$end{\{}abstract{\}}},

abstract = {A careful analysis of the HEAO1 A2 2-10 keV full-sky map of the X-ray background (XRB) reveals clustering on the scale of several degrees. After removing the contribution due to beam smearing, the intrinsic clustering of the background is found to be consistent with an auto-correlation function of the form (3.6 +- 0.9) x 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} theta{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} where theta is measured in degrees. If current AGN models of the hard XRB are reasonable and the cosmological constant-cold dark matter cosmology is correct, this clustering implies an X-ray bias factor of b{\_}X {\~{}} 2. Combined with the absence of a correlation between the XRB and the cosmic microwave background, this clustering can be used to limit the presence of an integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and thereby to constrain the value of the cosmological constant, Omega{\_}Lambda {\textless} 0.60 (95 {\%} C.L.). This constraint is inconsistent with much of the parameter space currently favored by other observations. Finally, we marginally detect the dipole moment of the diffuse XRB and find it to be consistent with the dipole due to our motion with respect to the mean rest frame of the XRB. The limit on the amplitude of any intrinsic dipole is delta I / I {\textless} 5 x 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} at the 95 {\%} C.L. When compared to the local bulk velocity, this limit implies a constraint on the matter density of the universe of Omega{\_}m{\^{}}{\{}0.6{\}}/b{\_}X(0) {\textgreater} 0.24.},

abstract = {Dust emission at sub-millimetre wavelengths allows us to trace the early phases of star formation in the Universe. In order to understand the physical processes involved in this mode of star formation, it is essential to gain knowledge about the dark matter structures - most importantly their masses - that sub-millimetre galaxies live in. Here we use the magnification effect of gravitational lensing to determine the average mass and dust content of sub-millimetre galaxies with 250mu flux densities of S{\_}250{\textgreater}15mJy selected using data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey. The positions of hundreds of sub-millimetre foreground lenses are cross-correlated with the positions of background Lyman-break galaxies at z{\~{}}3-5 selected using optical data from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We detect a cross-correlation signal at the 7-sigma level over a sky area of one square degree, with {\~{}}80{\%} of this signal being due to magnification, whereas the remaining {\~{}}20{\%} comes from dust extinction. Adopting some simple assumptions for the dark matter and dust profiles and the redshift distribution enables us to estimate the average mass of the halos hosting the sub-millimetre galaxies to be log(M{\_}200/M{\_}sun)=13.17+0.05-0.08(stat.) and their average dust mass fraction (at radii of {\textgreater}10kpc) to be M{\_}dust/M{\_}200{\~{}}6x10{\^{}}-5. This supports the picture that sub-millimetre galaxies are dusty, forming stars at a high rate, reside in massive group-sized halos, and are a crucial phase in the assembly and evolution of structure in the Universe.},

abstract = {We cross-match the two currently largest all-sky photometric catalogs, mid-infrared WISE and SuperCOSMOS scans of UKST/POSS-II photographic plates, to obtain a new galaxy sample that covers 3pi steradians. In order to characterize and purify the extragalactic dataset, we use external GAMA and SDSS spectroscopic information to define quasar and star loci in multicolor space, aiding the removal of contamination from our extended-source catalog. After appropriate data cleaning we obtain a deep wide-angle galaxy sample that is approximately 95{\%} pure and 90{\%} complete at high Galactic latitudes. The catalog contains close to 20 million galaxies over almost 70{\%} of the sky, outside the Zone of Avoidance and other confused regions, with a mean surface density of over 650 sources per square degree. Using multiwavelength information from two optical and two mid-IR photometric bands, we derive photometric redshifts for all the galaxies in the catalog, using the ANNz framework trained on the final GAMA-II spectroscopic data. Our sample has a median redshift of z{\_}{\{}med{\}} = 0.2 but with a broad dN/dz reaching up to z{\textgreater}0.4. The photometric redshifts have a mean bias of |delta{\_}z|{\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}, normalized scatter of sigma{\_}z = 0.033 and less than 3{\%} outliers beyond 3sigma{\_}z. Comparison with external datasets shows no significant variation of photo-z quality with sky position. Together with the overall statistics, we also provide a more detailed analysis of photometric redshift accuracy as a function of magnitudes and colors. The final catalog is appropriate for `all-sky' 3D cosmology to unprecedented depths, in particular through cross-correlations with other large-area surveys. It should also be useful for source pre-selection and identification in forthcoming surveys such as TAIPAN or WALLABY.},

Since the post-Born signal is non-linear, it also generates a bispectrum with the convergence. We show that the post-Born contributions to the bispectrum substantially change the shape predicted from large-scale structure non-linearities alone, and hence must be included to estimate the expected total signal and impact of bispectrum biases on CMB lensing reconstruction quadratic estimators and other observables. The field-rotation power spectrum only becomes potentially detectable for noise levels {\$}\backslashll 1 \backslashmu {\{}\backslashtext{\{}K{\}}{\}}\backslash,{\{}\backslashtext{\{}arcmin{\}}{\}}{\$}, but its bispectrum with the convergence may be observable at {\$}\backslashsim 3\backslashsigma{\$} with Stage IV observations.

We perform a case study of a three-channel balloon-borne CMB experiment observing the sky at (l,b)=(250deg,-38deg) and attaining a sensitivity of 5.25 muK-arcmin with 8' angular resolution at 150 GHz, in order to assess whether the effect of polarized Galactic dust is expected to be a significant contaminant to the lensing signal reconstructed using the EB quadratic estimator. We find that for our assumed dust model, polarization fractions of about as low as a few percent may lead to a significant dust bias to the lensing convergence power spectrum. We investigated a parametric component separation method, proposed by Stompor et al. (2009), as well as a template cleaning method, for mitigating the effect of this dust bias. The template-based method recovers unbiased convergence power spectrum in all polarization fraction cases we considered, while for the component separation technique we find a dust contrast regime in which the accuracy of the profile likelihood spectral index estimate breaks down, and in which external information on the dust frequency scaling is needed. We propose a criterion for putting a requirement on the accuracy with which the dust spectral index must be estimated or constrained, and demonstrate that if this requirement is met, then the dust bias can be removed.},

abstract = {We use the cosmic shear data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey to place constraints on {\$}f(R){\$} and {\{}$\backslash$it Generalized Dilaton{\}} models of modified gravity. This is highly complimentary to other probes since the constraints mainly come from the non-linear scales: maximal deviations with respects to the General-Relativity + {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM scenario occurs at {\$}k\backslashsim1 h \backslashmbox{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. At these scales, it becomes necessary to account for known degeneracies with baryon feedback and massive neutrinos, hence we place constraints jointly on these three physical effects. To achieve this, we formulate these modified gravity theories within a common tomographic parameterization, we compute their impact on the clustering properties relative to a GR universe, and propagate the observed modifications into the weak lensing {\$}\backslashxi{\_}{\{}\backslashpm{\}}{\$} quantity. Confronted against the cosmic shear data, we reject the {\$}f(R){\$} {\$}\backslash{\{} |f{\_}{\{}R{\_}0{\}}|=10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}, n=1\backslash{\}}{\$} model with more than 99.9{\%} confidence interval (CI) when assuming a {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM dark matter only model. In the presence of baryonic feedback processes and massive neutrinos with total mass up to 0.2eV, the model is disfavoured with at least 94{\%} CI in all different combinations studied. Constraints on the {\$}\backslash{\{} |f{\_}{\{}R{\_}0{\}}|=10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}, n=2\backslash{\}}{\$} model are weaker, but nevertheless disfavoured with at least 89{\%} CI. We identify several specific combinations of neutrino mass, baryon feedback and {\$}f(R){\$} or Dilaton gravity models that are excluded by the current cosmic shear data. Notably, universes with three massless neutrinos and no baryon feedback are strongly disfavoured in all modified gravity scenarios studied. These results indicate that competitive constraints may be achieved with future cosmic shear data.},

abstract = {Massive galaxies in the early Universe have been shown to be forming stars at surprisingly high rates 1— 3 . Prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies which are luminous when observed at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which may be forming stars at a rate of 1,000 solar masses (M ) per year 4—6 . These intense bursts of star formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies 7— 9 . However, probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within these galaxies is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largest telescopes at present. Here, we report observations of the sub-mm galaxy SMMJ2135-0102 at redshift z=2.3259 which has been gravitationally magnified by a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. This cosmic magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging, resolves the star-forming regions at a linear scale of just {\~{}}100 parsecs. We find that the luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are {\~{}}100 larger and 10 7 times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the underlying physics of the star formation processes at z{\~{}}2 appears to be similar to that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anything found in the present-day Universe. Strong gravitational lensing, light bent by massive galaxy clusters, magnifies the images of distant galaxies which serendipitously lie behind them, offering a direct route to probing the physical processes occurring within star-forming regions in high-redshift galaxies. During an 870m APEX/LABOCA observation of the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ2135-010217 (z cl =0.325), we recently discovered a uniquely bright galaxy with an 870m flux of 106.07.0mJy (Fig. 1). The optical counterpart is faint, with I AB =23.60.2 and K AB =19.770.07, and is extended along a roughly East-West direction, consistent with it being a gravitationally lensed background galaxy. The mid-and far-infrared colours (S 24 /S 70 =0.40.2) and red optical/near-infrared colours also suggest the galaxy lies beyond the cluster at z{\textgreater}1.5 10 (Supplementary Information) and indeed carbon monoxide (CO) J=1-0 emission at 34.64GHz unambiguously identified the redshift as z=2.32590.0001 (Fig. 2). With source and lens redshifts known, we used the gravitational lens model of the galaxy cluster (Supplementary Information) to correct for the lensing distortion, deriving an amplification factor for the background galaxy of =32.54.5.},

abstract = {The nature of the fuel that drives today's cosmic acceleration is an open and tantalizing mystery. We entertain the suggestion that the acceleration is not the manifestation of yet another new ingredient in the cosmic gas tank, but rather a signal of our first real lack of understanding of gravitational physics. By requiring that the underlying gravity theory respect Birkhoff's law, we derive the modified gravitational force law necessary to generate any given cosmology, without reference to the fundamental theory, revealing modifications of gravity at scales typically much smaller than today's horizon. We discuss how, through these modifications, the growth of density perturbations, the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, and even solar-system measurements may be sensitive to whether today's cosmic acceleration is generated by dark energy or modified gravitational dynamics, and are subject to imminent observational discrimination. We argue how these conclusions can be more generic, and probably not dependent on the validity of Birkhoff's law.},

abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of {\~{}}0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {\textless} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution {\~{}}250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

Our strongest signal is the thermal SZ, at the 3.1-3.7 $\backslash$sigma level, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction based on observations of X-ray clusters. We also see the ISW signal at the 2.5 $\backslash$sigma level, which is consistent with the expected value for the concordance LCDM cosmology, and is an independent signature of the presence of dark energy in the universe. Finally, we see the signature of microwave point sources at the 2.7 $\backslash$sigma level.},

abstract = {We present foreground-reduced CMB maps derived from the full Planck data set in both temperature and polarization. Compared to the corresponding Planck 2013 temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 for frequencies between 30 and 70 GHz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and 857 GHz. In addition, systematic errors in the forms of temperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversion uncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramatically reduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now be robustly recovered on angular scales {\$}\backslashell\backslashgtrsim40{\$}. On the very largest scales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared to the expected cosmological signal, and modes with {\$}\backslashell {\textless} 20{\$} are accordingly suppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. As in 2013, four different CMB component separation algorithms are applied to these observations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic and modelling choices. The resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noise ranging between 0.21 and 0.27{\$}\backslash,\backslashmu\backslashtextrm{\{}K{\}}{\$} averaged over 55 arcmin pixels, and between 4.5 and 6.1{\$}\backslash,\backslashmu\backslashtextrm{\{}K{\}}{\$} averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. The cosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectra are in agreement at the {\$}1\backslashsigma{\$} level with the Planck 2015 likelihood. Unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulations prevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical properties of the polarization maps. Thus, the primary applications of these polarization maps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimation of uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra and cross-correlations, or stacking analyses.},

If this distribution was Gaussian, the correlation function is amplified. The amplification for rich clusters is estimated to be eaual about ten and predicted trend of amplification with richness agrees qualitatively with that observed.

abstract = {We consider predictions for structure formation from modifications to general relativity in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by a general function of the Ricci scalar. We work without fixing a gauge, as well as in explicit popular coordinate choices, appropriate for the modification of existing cosmological code. We present the framework in a comprehensive and practical form that can be directly compared to standard perturbation analyses. By considering the full evolution equations, we resolve perceived instabilities previously suggested, and instead find a suppression of perturbations. This result presents significant challenges for agreement with current cosmological structure formation observations. The findings apply to a broad range of forms of f(R) for which the modification becomes important at low curvatures, disfavoring them in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. As such, these results provide a powerful method to rule out a wide class of modified gravity models aimed at providing an alternative explanation to the dark energy problem.},

abstract = {Context. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) is one of the two focal instruments of the Planck mission. It will observe the whole sky in six bands in the 100 GHz – 1 THz range. Aims. The HFI instrument is designed to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with a sensitivity limited only by fundamental sources: the photon noise of the CMB itself and the residuals left after the removal of foregrounds. The two high frequency bands will provide full maps of the submillimetre sky, featuring mainly extended and point source foregrounds. Systematic e ects must be kept at negligible levels or accurately monitored so that the signal can be corrected. This paper describes the HFI design and its characteristics deduced from ground tests and calibration. Methods. The HFI instrumental concept and architecture are feasible only by pushing to their extreme capabilities new techniques, mainly: (i) Bolometers working at 100 mK and absorbing the radiation in grids, (ii) a dilution cooler providing 100 mK in microgravity conditions, (iii) a new type of AC biased readout electronics and (iv) optical channels using devices inspired from radio and infrared techniques. Results. The Planck-HFI instrument performance exceeds requirements for sensitivity and control of systematic e ects. During ground-based calibration and tests, it has been measured at instrument and system levels to be close to or better than the goal specification.},

abstract = {We present the first calculation of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect due to the inhomogeneus reionization of the universe based on detailed large-scale radiative transfer simulations of reionization. The resulting sky power spectra peak at ??? = 2000-8000 with maximum values of [???(??? + 1)C???/(2??)]max ??? 4-7 ?? 10 -13. The scale roughly corresponds to the typical ionized bubble sizes observed in our simulations, of ???5-20 Mpc. The kSZ anisotropy signal from reionization dominates the primary CMB signal above ??? = 3000. At large-scales the patchy kSZ signal depends only on the source efficiencies. It is higher when sources are more efficient at producing ionizing photons, since such sources produce larger ionized regions, on average, than less efficient sources. The introduction of sub-grid gas clumping in the radiative transfer simulations produce significantly more power at small-scales, but has little effect at large-scales. The patchy reionization kSZ signal is dominated by the post-reionization signal from fully-ionized gas, but the two contributions are of similar order at scales ??? ??? 3000 - 104, indicating that the kSZ anisotropies from reionization are an important component of the total kSZ signal at these scales. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {While the selection of strongly lensed galaxies (SLGs) with 500 $\mu$m flux density S 500 {\textgreater} 100 mJy has proven to be rather straightforward, for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the ones obtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. Moreover, only by probing to fainter flux densities is it possible to exploit strong lensing to investigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. We describe HALOS (the Herschel-ATLAS Lensed Objects Selection), a method for efficiently selecting fainter candidate SLGs, reaching a surface density of {\~{}}= 1.5-2 deg-2, i.e., a factor of about 4-6 higher than that at the 100 mJy flux limit. HALOS will allow the selection of up to {\~{}}1000 candidate SLGs (with amplifications $\mu$ {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2) over the full H-ATLAS survey area. Applying HALOS to the H-ATLAS Science Demonstration Phase field (sime 14.4 deg2) we find 31 candidate SLGs, whose candidate lenses are identified in the VIKING near-infrared catalog. Using the available information on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a {\~{}}= 72{\%} purity of the sample. As expected, the purity decreases with decreasing flux density of the sources and with increasing angular separation between candidate sources and lenses. The redshift distribution of the candidate lensed sources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensed galaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to redshifts substantially higher than found in the other surveys. The counts of candidate SLGs are also in good agreement with model predictions. Even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infrared VIKING photometry, we show that H-ATLAS data alone allow the selection of a similarly deep sample of candidate SLGs with an efficiency close to 50{\%}; a slightly lower surface density (sime 1.45 deg-2) can be reached with a {\~{}}70{\%} efficiency.

abstract = {Separation of the E and B components of a microwave background polarization map or a weak lensing map is an essential step in extracting science from it, but when the map covers only part of the sky and/or is pixelized, this decomposition cannot be done perfectly. We present a method for decomposing an arbitrary sky map into a sum of three orthogonal components that we term ``pure E'', ``pure B'' and ``ambiguous''. This method is useful both for providing intuition for experimental design and for analyzing data sets in practice. We show how to find orthonormal bases for all three components in terms of bilaplacian eigenfunctions. The number of ambiguous modes is proportional to the length of the map boundary so fairly round maps are preferred. For real-world data analysis, we present a simple matrix eigenvalue method for calculating nearly pure E and B modes in pixelized maps. We find that the dominant source of leakage between E and B is aliasing of small-scale power caused by the pixelization. This problem can be eliminated by heavily oversampling the map, but is exacerbated by the fact that the E power spectrum is expected to be much larger than the B power spectrum and extremely blue. We found that a factor of 2 to 3 more pixels are needed in a polarization map to achieve the same level of contamination by aliased power than in a temperature map.},

The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters.

The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model.

We examine the effect of Born-corrections for lensing of the cosmic microwave background in an analytical approach by taking perturbative corrections to the geodesic into account. The resulting extra power in the lensing potential spectrum is comparable to the power generated by nonlinear structure formation and affects especially the polarisation spectra, leading to relative changes of the order of one per cent for the {\$}E{\$}-mode spectrum and up to 10 per cent on all scales to the {\$}B{\$}-mode spectrum. In contrast, there is only little change of spectra involving the CMB temperature. Additionally, the corrections excite one more degree of freedom resulting in a deflection component which can not be described as a gradient of the lensing potential as it is related to image rotation in lens-lens coupling. We estimate the magnitude of this effect on the CMB-spectra and find it to be negligible.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) gravitational lensing potential using data from the first two seasons of observations with SPTpol, the polarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The observations used in this work cover 100 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 GHz. Using a quadratic estimator, we make maps of the CMB lensing potential from combinations of CMB temperature and polarization maps. We combine these lensing potential maps to form a minimum-variance (MV) map. The lensing potential is measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than one for angular multipoles between {\$}100{\textless} L {\textless}250{\$}. This is the highest signal-to-noise mass map made from the CMB to date and will be powerful in cross-correlation with other tracers of large-scale structure. We calculate the power spectrum of the lensing potential for each estimator, and we report the value of the MV power spectrum between {\$}100{\textless} L {\textless}2000{\$} as our primary result. We constrain the ratio of the spectrum to a fiducial {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model to be {\$}A{\_}{\{}\backslashrm MV{\}}=0.92 \backslashpm 0.14 {\{}\backslashrm\backslash, (Stat.){\}} \backslashpm 0.08 {\{}\backslashrm\backslash, (Sys.){\}}{\$}.

abstract = {This article constructs flat-sky approximations in a controlled way in the context of the cosmic microwave background observations for the computation of both spectra and bispectra. For angular spectra, it is explicitly shown that there exists a whole family of flat-sky approximations of similar accuracy for which the expression and amplitude of next to leading order terms can be explicitly computed. It is noted that in this context two limiting cases can be encountered for which the expressions can be further simplified. They correspond to cases where either the sources are localized in a narrow region (thin-shell approximation) or are slowly varying over a large distance (which leads to the so-called Limber approximation). Applying this to the calculation of the spectra it is shown that, as long as the late integrated Sachs-Wolfe contribution is neglected, the flat-sky approximation at leading order is accurate at 1{\%} level for any multipole. Generalization of this construction scheme to the bispectra led to the introduction of an alternative description of the bispectra for which the flat-sky approximation is well controlled. This is not the case for the usual description of the bispectrum in terms of reduced bispectrum for which a flat-sky approximation is proposed but the next-to-leading order terms of which remain obscure.},

For each expansion history, fixed empirically by cosmological distance measures, there exists two branches of f(R) solutions that are parameterized by B propto d{\^{}}2 f/dR{\^{}}2. For B{\textless}0, which include most of the models previously considered, there is a short-timescale instability at high curvature that spoils agreement with high redshift cosmological observables. For the stable B{\textgreater}0 branch, f(R) models can reduce the large-angle CMB anisotropy, alter the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, and qualitatively change the correlations between the CMB and galaxy surveys. All of these phenomena are accessible with current and future data and provide stringent tests of general relativity on cosmological scales.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present results from the complete set of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation temperature anisotropy observations made with the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR) operating at 150 GHz. We include new data from the final 2005 observing season, expanding the number of detector hours by 210{\%} and the sky coverage by 490{\%} over that used for the previous ACBAR release. As a result, the band-power uncertainties have been reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third to fifth acoustic peaks as well as the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum. The calibration uncertainty has been reduced from 6{\%} to 2.1{\%} in temperature through a direct comparison of the CMB anisotropy measured by ACBAR with that of the dipole-calibrated WMAP5 experiment. The measured power spectrum is consistent with a spatially flat, $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. We include the effects of weak lensing in the power spectrum model computations and find that this significantly improves the fits of the models to the combined ACBAR+WMAP5 power spectrum. The preferred strength of the lensing is consistent with theoretical expectations. On fine angular scales, there is weak evidence (1.1$\sigma$) for excess power above the level expected from primary anisotropies. We expect any excess power to be dominated by the combination of emission from dusty protogalaxies and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the excess observed by ACBAR is significantly smaller than the excess power at ell{\textgreater}2000 reported by the CBI experiment operating at 30 GHz. Therefore, while it is unlikely that the CBI excess has a primordial origin; the combined ACBAR and CBI results are consistent with the source of the CBI excess being either the SZE or radio source contamination.},

We discuss the relevance and treatment of the residual {\$}E/B{\$} leakage for a number of considered sky apodizations as well as compromises and assumptions involved in an optimization of the resulting power spectrum uncertainty. In particular, we investigate the importance of a pixelization scheme, patch geometry, and sky signal priors used in apodization optimization procedures. In addition, we also present results derived for more realistic sky scans as motivated by the proposed balloon borne experiment EBEX. We conclude that the presented formalism thanks to its speed and efficiency can provide an interesting alternative to the CMB polarized power spectra estimators based on the optimal methods at least on angular scales smaller than {\~{}}10 degrees.

abstract = {Using a directional spherical wavelet analysis we detect the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, indicated by a positive correlation between the first-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data. Detections are made using both a directional extension of the spherical Mexican hat wavelet and the spherical butterfly wavelet. We examine the possibility of foreground contamination and systematics in the WMAP data and conclude that these factors are not responsible for the signal that we detect. The wavelet analysis inherently enables us to localise on the sky those regions that contribute most strongly to the correlation. On removing these localised regions the correlation that we detect is reduced in significance, as expected, but it is not eliminated, suggesting that these regions are not the sole source of correlation between the data. This finding is consistent with predictions made using the ISW effect, where one would expect weak correlations over the entire sky. In a flat universe the detection of the ISW effect provides direct and independent evidence for dark energy. We use our detection to constrain dark energy parameters by deriving a theoretical prediction for the directional wavelet covariance statistic for a given cosmological model. Comparing these predictions with the data we place constraints on the equation-of-state parameter {\$}w{\$} and the vacuum energy density {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashLambda{\$}. We also consider the case of a pure cosmological constant, i.e. {\$}w=-1{\$}. For this case we rule out a zero cosmological constant at greater than the 99.9{\%} significance level.

Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian-distributed, we show the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realisations of the data, their statistical properties are described by the Wishart and Inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a Figure-of-Merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realisations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5{\%} error on a parameter error and N{\_}D {\textless}{\textless} 100 data-points, a minimum of 200 realisations of the survey are needed, with 10{\%} accuracy for the data covariance. If the number of data-points N{\_}D {\textgreater}{\textgreater}100 we need N{\_}S {\textgreater} N{\_}D realisations and a fractional accuracy of {\textless}sqrt[2/N{\_}D] in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to N{\_}D{\textgreater}10{\^{}}4 -10{\^{}}6 this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling; shrinkage methods; data-compression; simulation and data resampling methods.},

abstract = {Based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the 2013 Planck Mission data release, this paper presents the detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, that is, the correlation between the CMB and large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. The significance of detection ranges from 2 to 4{\{}{\$}\sigma{\$}{\}}, depending on which method is used. We investigated three separate approaches, which essentially cover all previous studies, and also break new ground. (i) We correlated the CMB with the Planck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). This detection was made using the lensing-induced bispectrum between the low-{\{}$\backslash$ell{\}} and high-{\{}$\backslash$ell{\}} temperature anisotropies; the correlation between lensing and the ISW effect has a significance close to 2.5{\{}{\$}\sigma{\$}{\}}. (ii) We cross-correlated with tracers of large-scale structure, which yielded a significance of about 3{\{}{\$}\sigma{\$}{\}}, based on a combination of radio (NVSS) and optical (SDSS) data. (iii) We used aperture photometry on stacked CMB fields at the locations of known large-scale structures, which yielded and confirms a 4{\{}{\$}\sigma{\$}{\}} signal, over a broader spectral range, when using a previously explored catalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale when compared with expectations. More recent catalogues give more moderate results that range from negligible to 2.5{\{}{\$}\sigma{\$}{\}} at most, but have a more consistent scale and amplitude, the latter being still slightly higher than what is expected from numerical simulations within {\{}{\$}\Lambda{\$}{\}}CMD. Where they can be compared, these measurements are compatible with previous work using data from WMAP, where these scales have been mapped to the limits of cosmic variance. Planck's broader frequency coverage allows for better foreground cleaning and confirms that the signal is achromatic, which makes it preferable for ISW detection. As a final step we used tracers of large-scale structure to filter the CMB data, from which we present maps of the ISW temperature perturbation. These results provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of a dark energy component that governs the currently accelerated expansion of the Universe.},

abstract = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the CMB and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the SZ effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derived from CMB data and that derived from SZ data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2{\%} around the first acoustic peak.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the auto- and cross-frequency power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at 250, 350, and 500um (1200, 860, and 600 GHz) from observations totaling {\~{}} 70 deg{\^{}}2 made with the SPIRE instrument aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. We measure a fractional anisotropy dI / I = 14 +- 4{\%}, detecting signatures arising from the clustering of dusty star-forming galaxies in both the linear (2-halo) and non-linear (1-halo) regimes; and that the transition from the 2- to 1-halo terms, below which power originates predominantly from multiple galaxies within dark matter halos, occurs at k{\_}theta {\~{}} 0.1 - 0.12 arcmin{\^{}}-1 (l {\~{}} 2160 - 2380), from 250 to 500um. New to this paper is clear evidence of a dependence of the Poisson and 1-halo power on the flux-cut level of masked sources --- suggesting that some fraction of the more luminous sources occupy more massive halos as satellites, or are possibly close pairs. We measure the cross-correlation power spectra between bands, finding that bands which are farthest apart are the least correlated, as well as hints of a reduction in the correlation between bands when resolved sources are more aggressively masked. In the second part of the paper we attempt to interpret the measurements in the framework of the halo model. With the aim of fitting simultaneously with one model the power spectra, number counts, and absolute CIB level in all bands, we find that this is achievable by invoking a luminosity-mass relationship, such that the luminosity-to-mass ratio peaks at a particular halo mass scale and declines towards lower and higher mass halos. Our best-fit model finds that the halo mass which is most efficient at hosting star formation in the redshift range of peak star-forming activity, z {\~{}} 1-3, is log(M{\_}peak/M{\_}sun) {\~{}} 12.1 +- 0.5, and that the minimum halo mass to host infrared galaxies is log(M{\_}min/M{\_}sun) {\~{}} 10.1 +- 0.6.},

abstract = {We use microwave temperature maps from two seasons of data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope at 146 GHz, together with the "Constant Mass" CMASS galaxy sample from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey to measure the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect over the redshift range z=0.4-0.7. We use galaxy positions and the continuity equation to obtain a reconstruction of the line-of-sight velocity field. We stack the microwave temperature at the location of each halo, weighted by the corresponding reconstructed velocity. We vary the size of the aperture photometry filter used, thus probing the free electron profile of these halos from within the virial radius out to three virial radii, on the scales relevant for investigating the missing baryons problem. The resulting best fit kSZ model is preferred over the no-kSZ hypothesis at 3.3 and 2.9$\sigma$ for two independent velocity reconstruction methods, using 25,537 galaxies over 660 square degrees. The data suggest that the baryon profile is shallower than the dark matter in the inner regions of the halos probed here, potentially due to energy injection from active galactic nucleus or supernovae. Thus, by constraining the gas profile on a wide range of scales, this technique will be useful for understanding the role of feedback in galaxy groups and clusters. The effect of foregrounds that are uncorrelated with the galaxy velocities is expected to be well below our signal, and residual thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich contamination is controlled by masking the most massive clusters. Finally, we discuss the systematics involved in converting our measurement of the kSZ amplitude into the mean free electron fraction of the halos in our sample.},

abstract = {We develop the pseudo-Cl method for reconstructing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization auto- and cross-power spectra, and estimate the pseudo-Cl covariance matrix for a realistic experiment on the cut sky. We calculate the full coupling equations for all six possible CMB power spectra, relating the observed pseudo-Cl's to the underlying all-sky Cl's, and test the reconstruction on both full-sky and cut-sky simulated CMB data sets. In particular we consider the reconstruction of the Cl from upcoming ground-based polarization experiments covering areas of a few hundred sq. degrees and find that the method is fast, unbiased and performs well over a wide range of multipoles from l=2 to l=2500. We then calculate the full covariance matrix between the modes of the pseudo-temperature and polarization power spectra, assuming that the underlying CMB fields are Gaussian randomly distributed. The complexity of the covariance matrix prohibits its rapid calculation, required for parameter estimation. Hence we present an approximation for the covariance matrix in terms of convolutions of the underlying power spectra. The coupling matrices in these expressions can be estimated by fitting to numerical simulations, circumventing direct and slow calculation, and further, inaccurate analytic approximations. We show that these coupling matrices are mostly independent of cosmology, and that the full covariance matrix for all six pseudo-Cl power spectra can be quickly and accurately calculated for any given cosmological model using this method. We compare these semi-analytic covariance matrices against simulations and find good agreement, the accuracy of which depends mainly on survey area and the range of cosmological parameters considered.},

PIXIE will map the absolute intensity and linear polarization (Stokes I, Q, and U parameters) over the full sky in 400 spectral channels spanning 2.5 decades in frequency from 30 GHz to 6 THz (1 cm to 50 um wavelength). Multi-moded optics provide background-limited sensitivity using only 4 detectors, while the highly symmetric design and multiple signal modulations provide robust rejection of potential systematic errors. The principal science goal is the detection and characterization of linear polarization from an inflationary epoch in the early universe, with tensor-to-scalar ratio r {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} at 5 standard deviations. The rich PIXIE data set will also constrain physical processes ranging from Big Bang cosmology to the nature of the first stars to physical conditions within the interstellar medium of the Galaxy.},

abstract = {The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal is a powerful probe of the cosmic baryon distribution. The kSZ signal is proportional to the integrated free electron momentum rather than the electron pressure (which sources the thermal SZ signal). Since velocities should be unbiased on large scales, the kSZ signal is an unbiased tracer of the large-scale electron distribution, and thus can be used to detect the "missing baryon" that evade most observational techniques. While most current methods for kSZ extraction rely on the availability of very accurate redshifts, we revisit a method that allows measurements even in the absence of redshift information for individual objects. It involves cross-correlating the square of an appropriately filtered cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature map with a projected density map constructed from a sample of large-scale structure tracers. We show that this method will achieve high signal-to-noise when applied to the next generation of high-resolution CMB experiments, provided that component separation is sufficiently effective at removing foreground contamination. Considering statistical errors only, we forecast that this estimator can yield {\$}S/N \backslashapprox {\$} 3, 120 and over 150 for Planck, Advanced ACTPol, and hypothetical Stage-IV CMB experiments, respectively, in combination with a galaxy catalog from WISE, and about 20{\%} larger {\$}S/N{\$} for a galaxy catalog from the proposed SPHEREx experiment.

In order to address this bias, we also implement a MASTER-like technique in the needlet case. The resulting estimator turns out to have an extremely good signal-to-noise performance. Our analysis aims at expanding and optimizing the operating domains in CMB-LSS cross-correlation studies, similarly to CMB needlet data analysis.

Our main goal is to go beyond reporting detections towards developing a reliable likelihood analysis that allows one to determine cosmological constraints from ISW observations. With this in mind we spend a considerable amount of effort in determining the redshift-dependent bias and redshift distribution b(z)*dN/dz of these samples by matching with spectroscopic observations where available, and analyzing auto-power spectra and cross-power spectra between the samples. The data sets we use are 2-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) samples, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric Luminous Red Galaxies, SDSS photometric quasars and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio sources. We make a joint analysis of all samples constructing a full covariance matrix, which we subsequently use for cosmological parameter fitting. We report a 3.7 sigma detection of ISW combining all the datasets. We combine the ISW likelihood function with weak lensing of CMB and CMB power spectrum to constrain the equation of state of dark energy and the curvature of the Universe.

abstract = {We study a class of metric-variation f(R) models that accelerates the expansion without a cosmological constant and satisfies both cosmological and solar-system tests in the small-field limit of the parameter space. Solar-system tests alone place only weak bounds on these models, since the additional scalar degree of freedom is locked to the high-curvature general-relativistic prediction across more than 25 orders of magnitude in density, out through the solar corona. This agreement requires that the galactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature in the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic halo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper potentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f{\_}R| {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the acceleration epoch. Viability of large-deviation models therefore rests on the structure and evolution of the galactic halo, requiring cosmological simulations of f(R) models, and not directly on solar-system tests. Even small deviations that conservatively satisfy both galactic and solar-system constraints can still be tested by future, percent-level measurements of the linear power spectrum, while they remain undetectable to cosmological-distance measures. Although we illustrate these effects in a specific class of models, the requirements on f(R) are phrased in a nearly model-independent manner.},

abstract = {We present in a manifestly gauge-invariant form the theory of classical linear gravitational perturbations in part I, and a quantum theory of cosmological perturbations in part II. Part I includes applications to several important examples arising in cosmology: a univese dominated by hydrodynamical matter, a universe filled with scalar-field matter, and higher-derivative theories of gravity. The growth rates of perturbations are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. The gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations. The generation and evolution of gravitational waves is studied. As another example, a simple analysis of entropy perturbations and non-scale-invariant spectra in inflationary universe models is presented. The gauge-invariant theory of cosmological perturbations also allows a consistent and gauge-invariant definition of statistical fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

We first use the Generalized Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA) method to perform a component separation within a simplified framework which allows a high statistics Monte-Carlo study. For the second systematic, we apply a realistic mask on the temperature maps and then, restore them using a recent inpainting technique on the sphere. We investigate the reconstruction of the CMB lensing from the resultant maps using a quadratic estimator in the flat sky limit and on the full sphere. We find that the foreground residuals from the GMCA method does not alter significantly the lensed signal, nor does the mask corrected with the inpainting method, even in the presence of point sources residuals.},

As data quality improves rapidly, it has been suggested that the CMB lensing-LSS cross correlation may provide new insights into parameters describing cosmological structure growth. In this work we perform forecasts that combine the lensing potential auto power spectrum from various future CMB experiments, the galaxy power spectrum from galaxy surveys, as well as the cross power spectrum between the two, marginalizing over a number galactic and non-galactic cosmological parameters.

abstract = {We report a measurement of the B-mode polarization power spectrum in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using the POLARBEAR experiment in Chile. The faint B-mode polarization signature carries information about the Universe's entire history of gravitational structure formation, and the cosmic inflation that may have occurred in the very early Universe. Our measurement covers the angular multipole range 500 {\textless} l {\textless} 2100 and is based on observations of an effective sky area of 25 square degrees with 3.5 arcmin resolution at 150 GHz. On these angular scales, gravitational lensing of the CMB by intervening structure in the Universe is expected to be the dominant source of B-mode polarization. Including both systematic and statistical uncertainties, the hypothesis of no B-mode polarization power from gravitational lensing is rejected at 97.2{\%} confidence.

Fitting a single lensing amplitude parameter A{\_}BB to the measured band powers, A{\_}BB = 1.12 +/- 0.61 (stat) +0.04/-0.12 (sys) +/- 0.07 (multi), where A{\_}BB = 1 is the fiducial WMAP-9 LCDM value.

I improve their study by computing an analytic covariance from the Halo Model, implementing simulations to validate the theoretically estimated error bars and the reconstruction method, fitting both a galaxy bias and a cross-correlation amplitude using the joint cross and galaxy auto-correlation, and performing a series of null tests. Using a bayesian analysis, I find a galaxy bias {\$}b=0.92{\_}{\{}-0.02{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.02{\}}{\$} and a cross-correlation amplitude {\$}A=0.85{\_}{\{}-0.16{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.15{\}}{\$} for the 2015 release, whereas for the 2013 release I find {\$}b=0.93{\_}{\{}-0.02{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.02{\}}{\$} and {\$}A=1.05{\_}{\{}-0.15{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.15{\}}{\$}.

We use a simple model to provide a relation between the abundance of dark matter haloes and their spatial distribution on large scales. Our model shows that knowledge of the unconditional mass function alone is sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the large scale bias factor. Then we use the mass function measured in numerical simulations of SCDM, OCDM and LCDM to compute this bias. Comparison with these simulations shows that this simple way of estimating the bias relation and its evolution is accurate for less massive haloes as well as massive ones. In particular, we show that haloes which are less/more massive than typical M* haloes at the time they form are more/less strongly clustered than formulae based on the standard Press-Schechter mass function predict.},

abstract = {Planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and 857 GHz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 GHz in polarization. In this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical component separation, and process these maps within a Bayesian framework to derive a consistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. For the temperature analysis, we combine the Planck observations with the 9-year WMAP sky maps and the Haslam et al. 408 MHz map to derive a joint model of CMB, synchrotron, free-free, spinning dust, CO, line emission in the 94 and 100 GHz channels, and thermal dust emission. Full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutions varying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. Global parameters (monopoles, dipoles, relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the sky model, and best-fit values are tabulated. For polarization, the model includes CMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. These models provide excellent fits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK over 93{\%} of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional errors smaller than 1{\%} in the remaining 7{\%} of the sky. The main limitations of the temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among the spinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observations from external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. The main limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies are uncertainties in the 545 and 857 GHz calibration and zero-points. For polarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the 100-353 GHz bands on large angular scales in the form of temperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digital conversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expected to improve in the near future.},

The results of our analysis indicate the following scenario: (1) the star formation in the host galaxy proceeds within a heavily dust-enshrouded medium at an almost constant rate over a timescale {\textless}{\~{}} 0.5-1 Gyr and then abruptly declines due to quasar feedback, over the same timescale; (2) part of the interstellar medium loses angular momentum, reaches the circum-nuclear regions at a rate proportional to the star formation, and is temporarily stored in a massive reservoir/proto-torus wherefrom it can be promptly accreted; (3) the BH grows by accretion in a self-regulated regime with radiative power that can slightly exceed the Eddington limit L/L Edd {\textless}{\~{}} 4, particularly at the highest redshifts; (4) for massive BHs, the ensuing energy feedback at its maximum exceeds the stellar one and removes the interstellar gas, thus stopping the star formation and the fueling of the reservoir; (5) afterward, if the latter has retained enough gas, a phase of supply-limited accretion follows, exponentially declining with a timescale of about two e-folding times. We also discuss how the detailed properties and the specific evolution of the reservoir can be investigated via coordinated, high-resolution observations of star-forming, strongly lensed galaxies in the (sub-)mm band with ALMA and in the X-ray band with Chandra and the next-generation X-ray instruments.},

abstract = {The so-called Limber equation is widely used in the literature to relate the projected angular clustering of galaxies to the spatial clustering of galaxies in an approximate way. This paper gives estimates of where the regime of applicability of Limber's equation stops. Limber's equation is accurate for small galaxy separations but breaks down beyond a certain separation that depends mainly on the ratio sigma/R and to some degree on the power-law index, gamma, of spatial clustering xi; sigma is the one-sigma width of the galaxy distribution in comoving distance, and R the mean comoving distance. As rule-of-thumb, a 10{\%} relative error is reached at 260 sigma/R arcmin for gamma{\~{}}1.6, if the spatial clustering is a power-law. More realistic xi are discussed in the paper. Limber's equation becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger angular separations. Ignoring this effect and blindly applying Limber's equation can possibly bias results for the inferred spatial correlation. It is suggested to use in cases of doubt, or maybe even in general, the exact equation that can easily be integrated numerically in the form given in the paper.},

While working in the Jordan frame, we perform an analytical study of the growth of structures in the Einstein frame, demonstrating the equivalence of the dynamics in the two frames. We also provide a physical interpretation of the results in terms of the dynamics of an effective dark energy fluid with a non-zero shear. We find that the growth of structure in f(R) is enhanced, but that there are no small scale instabilities associated with the additional attractive "fifth force". We then briefly consider some recently proposed observational tests of modified gravity and their utility for detecting the f(R) pattern of structure growth.},

In this Letter we present a summary of the spatial properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation based on the full 4 years of COBE DMR observations, as detailed in a set of companion Letters. The anisotropy is consistent with a scale-invariant power law model and Gaussian statistics. With full use of the multi-frequency 4-year DMR data, including our estimate of the effects of Galactic emission, we find a power-law spectral index of {\$}n=1.2\backslashpm 0.3{\$} and a quadrupole normalization {\$}Q{\_}{\{}rms-PS{\}}=15.3{\^{}}{\{}+3.8{\}}{\_}{\{}-2.8{\}}{\$} {\$}\backslashmu{\$}K.

These values are consistent with both our previous 1-year and 2-year results. The results include use of the {\$}\backslashell=2{\$} quadrupole term; exclusion of this term gives consistent results, but with larger uncertainties. The 4-year sky maps, presented in this Letter, portray an accurate overall visual impression of the anisotropy since the signal-to-noise ratio is {\~{}}2 per 10 degree sky map patch. The improved signal-to-noise ratio of the 4-year maps also allows for improvements in Galactic modeling and limits on non-Gaussian statistics.},

abstract = {We present the most significant measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential to date (at a level of 40$\sigma$), using temperature and polarization data from the Planck 2015 full-mission release. Using a polarization-only estimator we detect lensing at a signifi- cance of 5$\sigma$. We cross-check the accuracy of our measurement using the wide frequency coverage and complementarity of the temperature and polarization measurements. Public products based on this measurement include an estimate of the lensing potential over approximately 70{\%} of the sky, an estimate of the lensing potential power spectrum in bandpowers for the multipole range 40≤L≤400 and an associated likelihood for cosmological parameter constraints. We find good agreement between our measurement of the lensing potential power spectrum and that found in the best-fitting $\Lambda$CDM model based on the Planck temperature and polarization power spectra. Using the lensing likelihood alone we obtain a percent-level measurement of the parameter combination $\sigma$8Ω0.25 m = 0.591 ± 0.021. We combine our determination of the lensing potential with the E-mode polarization also measured by Planck to generate an estimate of the lensing B-mode. We show that this lensing B-mode estimate is correlated with the B-modes observed directly by Planck at the expected level and with a statistical significance of 10$\sigma$, confirming Planck's sensitivity to this known sky signal. We also correlate our lensing potential estimate with the large-scale temperature anisotropies, detecting a cross-correlation at the 3$\sigma$ level, as expected due to dark energy in the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present a comprehensive investigation of the cosmological evolution of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the infrared (IR). Based on the observed dichotomy in the ages of stellar populations of early-type galaxies on one side and late-type galaxies on the other, the model interprets the epoch-dependent LFs at z $\backslash$geq 1.5 using a physical model for the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies and of the associated AGNs, while IR galaxies at z{\textless}1.5 are interpreted as being mostly late-type 'cold' (normal) and 'warm' (starburst) galaxies. As for proto-spheroids, in addition to the epoch-dependent LFs of stellar and AGN components separately, we have worked out the evolving LFs of these objects as a whole (stellar plus AGN component). The model provides a physical explanation for the observed positive evolution of both galaxies and AGNs up to z $\backslash$simeq 2.5 and for the negative evolution at higher redshifts, for the sharp transition from Euclidean to extremely steep counts at (sub-)mm wavelengths, as well as the (sub-)mm counts of strongly lensed galaxies, that are hard to account for by alternative, physical or phenomenological, approaches. The evolution of late-type galaxies and of z{\textless}1.5 AGNs is described using a parametric phenomenological approach. The modeled AGN contributions to the counts and to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) are always subdominant with maximal at mid-IR wavelengths. The model provides a good fit to the multi-wavelength (from the mid-IR to millimeter waves) data on LFs at different redshifts and on number counts (both global and per redshift slices). A prediction of the present model is a systematic variation with wavelength of the populations dominating the counts and the contributions to the CIB intensity. The implied specific trend for cross-wavelength CIB power spectra is found to be in good agreement with the data.},

abstract = {Future experiments will produce high-resolution temperature maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and are expected to reveal the signature of gravitational lensing by intervening large-scale structures. We construct all-sky maximum-likelihood estimators that use the lensing effect to estimate the projected density (convergence) of these structures, its power spectrum, and cross-correlation with other observables. This contrasts with earlier quadratic-estimator approaches that Taylor-expanded the observed CMB temperature to linear order in the lensing deflection angle; these approaches gave estimators for the temperature-convergence correlation in terms of the CMB three-point correlation function and for the convergence power spectrum in terms of the CMB four-point correlation function, which can be biased and non-optimal due to terms beyond the linear order. We show that for sufficiently weak lensing, the maximum-likelihood estimator reduces to the computationally less demanding quadratic estimator. The maximum likelihood and quadratic approaches are compared by evaluating the root-mean-square (RMS) error and bias in the reconstructed convergence map in a numerical simulation; it is found that both the RMS errors and bias are of order 1 percent for the case of Planck and of order 10--20 percent for a 1 arcminute beam experiment. We conclude that for recovering lensing information from temperature data acquired by these experiments, the quadratic estimator is close to optimal, but further work will be required to determine whether this is also the case for lensing of the CMB polarization field.},

abstract = {The creation and evolution of energy-density perturbations are analyzed for the "new inflationary universe" scenario proposed by Linde, and Albrecht and Steinhardt. According to the scenario, the Universe underwent a strongly first-order phase transition and entered a "de Sitter phase" of exponential expansion during which all previously existing energy-density perturbations expanded to distance scales very large compared to the size of our observable Universe. The existence of an event horizon during the de Sitter phase gives rise to zero-point fluctuations in the scalar field $\phi$, whose slowly growing expectation value signals the transition to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) phase of a grand unified theory (GUT). The fluctuations in $\phi$ are created on small distance scales and expanded to large scales, eventually giving rise to an almost scale-free spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations (the so-called Zel'dovich spectrum). When a fluctuation reenters the horizon (radius≃H-1) during the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) phase that follows the exponential expansion, it has a perturbation amplitude $\delta$$\rho$/$\rho$|H=(4 or 2/5)H$\Delta$$\phi$/$\phi$̇(t1), where H is the Hubble constant during the de Sitter phase (H-1 is the radius of the event horizon), $\phi$̇(t1) is the mean value of $\phi$̇ at the time (t1) that the wavelength of the perturbation expanded beyond the Hubble radius during the de Sitter epoch, $\Delta$$\phi$ is the fluctuation in $\phi$ at time t1 on the same scale, and 4(2/5) applies if the Universe is radiation (matter) dominated when the scale in question reenters the horizon. Scales larger than about 1015-1016M⊙ reenter the horizon when the Universe is matter dominated. Owing to the Sachs-Wolfe effect, these density perturbations give rise to temperature fluctuations in the microwave background which, on all angular scales ≫1°, are $\delta$T/T≃(1/5)H$\Delta$$\phi$/$\phi$̇(t1). The value of $\Delta$$\phi$ expected from de Sitter fluctuations is O(H/2$\pi$). For the simplest model of "new inflation," that based on an SU(5) GUT with Coleman-Weinberg SSB, $\phi$̇(t1)≪H2 so that $\delta$T/T≫1—in obvious conflict with the large-scale isotropy of the microwave background. One remedy for this is a model in which the inflation occurs when $\phi$̇(t1)≫H2. We analyze a supersymmetric model which has this feature, and show that a value of $\delta$$\rho$/$\rho$|H≃10-4-10-3 on all observable scales is not implausible.},

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

We describe the data reduction, which poses specific challenges, both because of the sheer size of the data, and because only two scans are made for each region. We implement effective solutions to process the bolometric timelines into maps, and show that correlations among detectors are negligible, and that the photometer is stable on time scales up to 250 s. This is longer than the time the telescope takes to cross the observed sky region, and it allows us to use naive binning methods for an optimal reconstruction of the sky emission. The maps have equal contribution of confusion and white instrumental noise, and the latter is estimated to 5.3, 6.4, and 6.7 mJy/beam (1-{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}), at 250, 350, and 500 $\backslash$mu{\{}m{\}}, respectively.

The measured amplitude of the signal agrees with Lambda cold dark matter cosmology predictions.

abstract = {We construct the spin flaglet transform, a wavelet transform to analyze spin signals in three dimensions. Spin flaglets can probe signal content localized simultaneously in space and frequency and, moreover, are separable so that their angular and radial properties can be controlled independently. They are particularly suited to analyzing of cosmological observations such as the weak gravitational lensing of galaxies. Such observations have a unique 3D geometrical setting since they are natively made on the sky, have spin angular symmetries, and are extended in the radial direction by additional distance or redshift information. Flaglets are constructed in the harmonic space defined by the Fourier-Laguerre transform, previously defined for scalar functions and extended here to signals with spin symmetries. Thanks to various sampling theorems, both the Fourier-Laguerre and flaglet transforms are theoretically exact when applied to bandlimited signals. In other words, in numerical computations the only loss of information is due to the finite representation of floating point numbers. We develop a 3D framework relating the weak lensing power spectrum to covariances of flaglet coefficients. We suggest that the resulting novel flaglet weak lensing estimator offers a powerful alternative to common 2D and 3D approaches to accurately capture cosmological information. While standard weak lensing analyses focus on either real or harmonic space representations (i.e., correlation functions or Fourier-Bessel power spectra, respectively), a wavelet approach inherits the advantages of both techniques, where both complicated sky coverage and uncertainties associated with the physical modeling of small scales can be handled effectively. Our codes to compute the Fourier-Laguerre and flaglet transforms are made publicly available.},

abstract = {We study the effects of modified theories of gravity on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies power spectrum, and in particular on its large scales, where the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is important. Starting with a general parametrisation, we then specialise to f(R) theories and theories with Yukawa-type interactions between dark matter particles. In these models, the evolution of the metric potentials is altered, and the contribution to the ISW effect can differ significantly from that in the standard model of cosmology. We proceed to compare these predictions with observational data for the CMB and the ISW, performing a full Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analysis. In the case of f(R) theories, the result is an upper limit on the lengthscale associated to the extra scalar degree of freedom characterising these theories. With the addition of data from the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae, we obtain an upper limit on the lengthscale of the theory of B{\_}0 {\textless} 0.4, or correspondingly $\backslash$lambda{\_}1 {\textless} 1900 Mpc/h at 95{\%} c.l. improving previous CMB constraints. For Yukawa-type models we get a bound on the coupling 0.75 {\textless} $\backslash$beta{\_}1 {\textless} 1.25 at the 95{\%} c.l. We also discuss the implications of the assumed priors on the estimation of modified gravity parameters, showing that a marginally less conservative choice improves the f(R) constraints to $\backslash$lambda{\_}1 {\textless} 1400 Mpc/h, corresponding to B{\_}0 {\textless} 0.2 at 95{\%} c.l.},

abstract = {Inflationary cosmology has been developed over the last twenty years to remedy serious shortcomings in the standard hot big bang model of the universe. Taking an original approach, this textbook explains the basis of modern cosmology and shows where the theoretical results come from. The book is divided into two parts; the first deals with the homogeneous and isotropic model of the Universe, the second part discusses how inhomogeneities can explain its structure. Established material such as the inflation and quantum cosmological perturbation are presented in great detail, however the reader is brought to the frontiers of current cosmological research by the discussion of more speculative ideas. An ideal textbook for both advanced students of physics and astrophysics, all of the necessary background material is included in every chapter and no prior knowledge of general relativity and quantum field theory is assumed. Presents detailed derivations of all basic results needed in cosmology, including robust predictions of inflation Contains an analytical treatment of nucleosynthesis, recombination and CMB fluctuations Provides elementary introductions to more advanced topics},

abstract = {We investigate anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background (CIB) using a combination of the physical evolutionary model for proto-spheroid galaxies of Granato et al. and an independent halo occupation distribution analysis. After having re-calibrated the cumulative flux function dS/dz at ?m using the available determinations of the shot-noise amplitude (the original model already correctly reproduced it at shorter wavelengths), the CIB power spectra at wavelengths from ?m to 2 mm measured by Planck, Herschel, South Pole Telescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope experiments have been fitted using the halo model with only two free parameters, the minimum halo mass and the power-law index of the mean occupation function of satellite galaxies. The best-fitting minimum halo massis log (Mmin/M⊙) = 12.24 ± 0.06, higher than, but consistent within the errors, the estimate by Amblard et al. and close to the estimate by Planck Collaboration. The redshift evolution of the volume emissivity of galaxies yielded by the model is found to be consistent with that inferred from the data. The derived effective halo mass, Meff≃ 5 × 1012 M⊙, of z≃ 2 submillimetre galaxies is close to that estimated for the most efficient star formers at the same redshift. The effective bias factor and the comoving clustering radius at z≃ 2 yielded by the model are substantially lower than those found for a model whereby the star formation is fuelled by steady gas accretion, but substantially higher than those found for a merger-driven galaxy evolution with a top-heavy initial mass function.},

abstract = {We present foreground-reduced CMB maps derived from the full Planck data set in both temperature and polarization. Compared to the corresponding Planck 2013 temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 for frequencies between 30 and 70 GHz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and 857 GHz. In addition, systematic errors in the forms of temperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversion uncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramatically reduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now be robustly recovered on angular scales {\$}\backslashell\backslashgtrsim40{\$}. On the very largest scales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared to the expected cosmological signal, and modes with {\$}\backslashell {\textless} 20{\$} are accordingly suppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. As in 2013, four different CMB component separation algorithms are applied to these observations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic and modelling choices. The resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noise ranging between 0.21 and 0.27{\$}\backslash,\backslashmu\backslashtextrm{\{}K{\}}{\$} averaged over 55 arcmin pixels, and between 4.5 and 6.1{\$}\backslash,\backslashmu\backslashtextrm{\{}K{\}}{\$} averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. The cosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectra are in agreement at the {\$}1\backslashsigma{\$} level with the Planck 2015 likelihood. Unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulations prevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical properties of the polarization maps. Thus, the primary applications of these polarization maps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimation of uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra and cross-correlations, or stacking analyses.},

To this aim, we use the small deflection angle approximation, to connect the lensed and unlensed power spectra, via expressions for the deflection angles up to third order in the gravitational potential. While the small deflection angle approximation has the drawback to be reliable only for multipoles {\$}\backslashell\backslashlesssim 2500{\$}, it allows us to consistently take into account the non-Gaussian nature of cosmological perturbation theory beyond the linear level. The contribution to the lensed temperature power spectrum coming from the non-Gaussian nature of the deflection angle at higher order is a new effect which has not been taken into account in the literature so far. It turns out to be the leading contribution among the post-Born lensing corrections. On the other hand, the effect is smaller than corrections coming from non-linearities in the matter power spectrum, and its imprint on CMB lensing is too small to be seen in present experiments.},

Needlets are a form of spherical wavelets which do not rely on any kind of tangent plane approximation and enjoy good localization properties in both pixel and harmonic space; moreover needlets coefficients are asymptotically uncorrelated at any fixed angular distance, which makes their use in statistical procedures very promising. In view of these properties, we believe needlets may turn out to be especially useful in the analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data on the incomplete sky, as well as of other cosmological observations. As a final advantage, we stress that the implementation of needlets is computationally very convenient and may rely completely on standard data analysis packages such as HEALPix.},

abstract = {Context. Future cosmological surveys will provide 3D large scale structure maps with large sky coverage, for which a 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) analysis in spherical coordinates is natural. Wavelets are particularly well-suited to the analysis and denoising of cosmological data, but a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform does not currently exist to analyse spherical 3D data. Aims: The aim of this paper is to present a new formalism for a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet, i.e. one based on the SFB decomposition of a 3D field and accompany the formalism with a public code to perform wavelet transforms. Methods: We describe a new 3D isotropic spherical wavelet decomposition based on the undecimated wavelet transform (UWT) described in Starck et al. (2006). We also present a new fast discrete spherical Fourier-Bessel transform (DSFBT) based on both a discrete Bessel transform and the HEALPIX angular pixelisation scheme. We test the 3D wavelet transform and as a toy-application, apply a denoising algorithm in wavelet space to the Virgo large box cosmological simulations and find we can successfully remove noise without much loss to the large scale structure. Results: We have described a new spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform, ideally suited to analyse and denoise future 3D spherical cosmological surveys, which uses a novel DSFBT. We illustrate its potential use for denoising using a toy model. All the algorithms presented in this paper are available for download as a public code called MRS3D at http://jstarck.free.fr/mrs3d.html},

We estimate the pairwise momentum of the kSZ temperature fluctuations at the positions of the CGC (Central Galaxy Catalogue) samples extracted from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR7) data. For the foreground-cleaned maps, we find {\$}1.8{\$}-{\$}2.5\backslashsigma{\$} detections of the kSZ signal, which are consistent with the kSZ evidence found in individual Planck raw frequency maps, although lower than found in the WMAP-9yr W band ({\$}3.3\backslashsigma{\$}). We further reconstruct the peculiar velocity field from the CG density field, and compute for the first time the cross-correlation function between kSZ temperature fluctuations and estimates of CG radial peculiar velocities. This correlation function yields a {\$}3.0{\$}-{\$}3.7{\$}{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on Mpc scales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 {\$}h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} Mpc. Both the pairwise momentum estimates and kSZ temperature-velocity field correlation find evidence for kSZ signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond, corresponding to a physical radius of {\$}{\textgreater} 1{\$} Mpc, more than twice the mean virial radius of halos. This is consistent with the predictions from hydro simulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. We fit a simple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation is proportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon N-body simulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective" optical depth to Thomson scattering. We find {\$}\backslashtau{\_}T=(1.4\backslashpm0.5)\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$}; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of the gas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to X-ray or thermal SZ observations.},

abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14{\~{}}May 2009 and scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12{\~{}}August 2009 and 23{\~{}}October 2013. In February{\~{}}2015, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire Planck mission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the data products in the release, as well as the associated cosmological and astrophysical science results and papers. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations of signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methods and assessment of uncertainties. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data are described, as well as a CMB lensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters deriving from CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as constraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark energy, and modified gravity.},

At all frequencies with detectable signal we infer a redshift distribution peaking around z {\~{}} 1.2 and find the recovered spectrum to be consistent with emission arising from star forming galaxies. By assuming simple modified blackbody and Kennicutt relations, we estimate dust and star formation rate density as a function of redshift, finding results consistent with earlier multiwavelength measurements over a large portion of cosmic history. However, we note that, lacking mid-infrared coverage, we are not able to make an accurate determination of the mean temperature for the dust responsible for the CIB. Our results demonstrate that clustering-based redshift inference is a valuable tool for measuring the entire evolution history of the cosmic star formation rate from a single and homogeneous dataset.},

abstract = {We present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of the dust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic history using data from the Science Demonstration Phase of the Herschel-ATLAS. The sample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m which have reliable counterparts from SDSS at z {\textless} 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. Dust masses are calculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectral energy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperature components. The dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift. Splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in the dust properties of the most massive galaxies. At z = 0.4 - 0.5, massive galaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local Universe. At the same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, and the optical depth derived from fitting the UV-sub-mm data with an energy balance model was also higher. This increase in the dust content of massive galaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolution models and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either a more top-heavy IMF, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction or combinations of all three. This evolution in dust mass is likely to be associated with a change in overall ISM mass, and points to an enhanced supply of fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.},

It can be used to benchmark the accuracy of the CAMB code in curved space, which is found to match expectations. For default precision settings, corresponding to 0.1{\%} for scalar temperature spectra and 0.2{\%} for scalar polarisation spectra, our code is two to three times faster, depending on curvature. We also simplify the temperature and polarisation source terms significantly, so the different contributions to the {\$}C{\_}\backslashell{\$}'s are easy to identify inside the code.},

The average density of maxima of a general three-dimensional Gaussian field is calculated as a function of heights of the maxima, and the average density of 'upcrossing' points on density contour surfaces is computed. The number density of peaks subject to the constraint that the large-scale density field be fixed is determined and used to discuss the segregation of high peaks from the underlying mass distribution. The machinery to calculate n-point peak-peak correlation functions is determined, as are the shapes of the profiles about maxima.},

abstract = {We extend the theory of weak gravitational lensing to cosmologies with generalized gravity, described in the Lagrangian by a generic function depending on the Ricci scalar and a non-minimal coupled scalar field. We work out the generalized Poisson equations relating the dynamics of the fluctuating components to the two gauge invariant scalar gravitational potentials, fixing the new contributions from the modified background expansion and fluctuations. We show how the lensing equation gets modified by the cosmic expansion as well as by the presence of the anisotropic stress, which is non-null at the linear level both in scalar-tensor gravity and in theories where the gravitational Lagrangian term features a non-minimal dependence on the Ricci scalar. Starting from the geodesic deviation, we derive the generalized expressions for the shear tensor and projected lensing potential, encoding the spacetime variation of the effective gravitational constant and isolating the contribution of the anisotropic stress, which introduces a correction due to the spatial correlation between the gravitational potentials. Finally, we work out the expressions of the lensing convergence power spectrum as well as the correlation between the lensing potential and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect affecting Cosmic Microwave Background total intensity and polarization anisotropies. To illustrate phenomenologically the new effects, we work out approximate expressions for the quantities above in Extended Quintessence scenarios where the scalar field coupled to gravity plays the role of the dark energy.},

abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year WMAP data, in conjunction with additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter LCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l CMB anisotropy, the BAO scale, and the Hubble constant, the densities, Omegabh2, Omegach2, and Omega{\_}L, are each determined to a precision of {\~{}}1.5{\%}. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3{\%}, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r{\textless}0.13 (95{\%} CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is {\textless}0.44 eV (95{\%} CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40 when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent PLANCK measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

We review the most important properties of spin needlets, such as localization in pixel and harmonic space and asymptotic uncorrelation.

The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

abstract = {This monograph is devoted to a completely new approach to geometric problems arising in the study of random fields. The groundbreaking material in Part III, for which the background is carefully prepared in Parts I and II, is of both theoretical and practical importance, and striking in the way in which problems arising in geometry and probability are beautifully intertwined.The three parts to the monograph are quite distinct. Part I presents a user-friendly yet comprehensive background to the general theory of Gaussian random fields, treating classical topics such as continuity and boundedness, entropy and majorizing measures, Borell and Slepian inequalities. Part II gives a quick review of geometry, both integral and Riemannian, to provide the reader with the material needed for Part III, and to give some new results and new proofs of known results along the way. Topics such as Crofton formulae, curvature measures for stratified manifolds, critical point theory, and tube formulae are covered. In fact, this is the only concise, self-contained treatment of all of the above topics, which are necessary for the study of random fields. The new approach in Part III is devoted to the geometry of excursion sets of random fields and the related Euler characteristic approach to extremal probabilities."Random Fields and Geometry" will be useful for probabilists and statisticians, and for theoretical and applied mathematicians who wish to learn about new relationships between geometry and probability. It will be helpful for graduate students in a classroom setting, or for self-study. Finally, this text will serve as a basic reference for all those interested in the companion volume of the applications of the theory. These applications, to appear in a forthcoming volume, will cover areas as widespread as brain imaging, physical oceanography, and astrophysics.},

abstract = {We present the first major data release of the largest single key-project in area carried out in open time with the Herschel Space Observatory. The Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) is a survey of 600 deg{\^{}}2 in five photometric bands - 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 um - with the PACS and SPIRE cameras. In this paper and a companion paper (Bourne et al. 2016) we present the survey of three fields on the celestial equator, covering a total area of 161.6 deg{\^{}}2 and previously observed in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey. This paper describes the Herschel images and catalogues of the sources detected on the SPIRE 250 um images. The 1-sigma noise for source detection, including both confusion and instrumental noise, is 7.4, 9.4 and 10.2 mJy at 250, 350 and 500 um. Our catalogue includes 120230 sources in total, with 113995, 46209 and 11011 sources detected at {\textgreater}4-sigma at 250, 350 and 500 um. The catalogue contains detections at {\textgreater}3-sigma at 100 and 160 um for 4650 and 5685 sources, and the typical noise at these wavelengths is 44 and 49 mJy. We include estimates of the completeness of the survey and of the effects of flux bias and also describe a novel method for determining the true source counts. The H-ATLAS source counts are very similar to the source counts from the deeper HerMES survey at 250 and 350 um, with a small difference at 500 um. Appendix A provides a quick start in using the released datasets, including instructions and cautions on how to use them.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background generates a curl pattern in the observed polarization. This "B-mode" signal provides a measure of the projected mass distribution over the entire observable Universe and also acts as a contaminant for the measurement of primordial gravity-wave signals. In this Letter we present the first detection of gravitational lensing B modes, using first-season data from the polarization-sensitive receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPTpol). We construct a template for the lensing B-mode signal by combining E-mode polarization measured by SPTpol with estimates of the lensing potential from a Herschel-SPIRE map of the cosmic infrared background. We compare this template to the B modes measured directly by SPTpol, finding a non-zero correlation at 7.7 sigma significance. The correlation has an amplitude and scale-dependence consistent with theoretical expectations, is robust with respect to analysis choices, and constitutes the first measurement of a powerful cosmological observable.},

abstract = {We introduce EFTCAMB/EFTCosmoMC as publicly available patches to the commonly used camb/CosmoMC codes. We briefly describe the structure of the codes, their applicability and main features. To illustrate the use of these patches, we obtain constraints on parametrized pure effective field theory and designer f(R) models, both on $\Lambda$CDM and wCDM background expansion histories, using data from Planck temperature and lensing potential spectra, WMAP low-ℓ polarization spectra (WP), and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Upon inspecting the theoretical stability of the models on the given background, we find nontrivial parameter spaces that we translate into viability priors. We use different combinations of data sets to show their individual effects on cosmological and model parameters. Our data analysis results show that, depending on the adopted data sets, in the wCDM background case these viability priors could dominate the marginalized posterior distributions. Interestingly, with Planck +WP+BAO+lensing data, in f(R) gravity models, we get very strong constraints on the constant dark energy equation of state, w0∈(-1,-0.9997) (95{\%} C.L.).},

abstract = {On the arcminute angular scales probed by Planck, the CMB anisotropies are gently perturbed by gravitational lensing. Here we present a detailed study of this effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217GHz frequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. We use the temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a (noisy) map of the CMB lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure of the mass distribution back to the CMB last-scattering surface. Our lensing potential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact which we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale structure. We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding generally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting LCDM model for the Planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100 correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures which source the lensing potential. When combined with the temperature power spectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter constraints; it improves CMB-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of two and also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordial perturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing a measurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of large-scale polarization data. Discarding scale information, our measurement corresponds to a 4{\%} constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential power spectrum, or a 2{\%} constraint on the RMS amplitude of matter fluctuations at z{\~{}}2.},

Employing this focal plane along with stringent control over systematic errors, POLARBEAR has the sensitivity to detect the expected small scale B-mode signal due to gravitational lensing and search for the large scale B-mode signal from inflationary gravitational waves.

abstract = {The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the Planck satellite. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to persist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the low-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to arbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Although these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.},

The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor (TES) 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of approx. 300 uk.sqrt(s). BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square degrees was observed to a depth of 87 nK-degrees in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-LCDM expectation in the range 30{\textless}l{\textless}150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of {\$}{\textgreater}5\backslashsigma{\$}. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. We also estimate potential foreground signals and find that available models predict these to be considerably smaller than the observed signal. These foreground models possess no significant cross-correlation with our maps. Additionally, cross-correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring synchrotron or dust at {\$}2.3\backslashsigma{\$} and {\$}2.2\backslashsigma{\$}, respectively. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well-fit by a lensed-LCDM + tensor theoretical model with tensor/scalar ratio {\$}r=0.20{\^{}}{\{}+0.07{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.05{\}}{\$}, with r=0 disfavored at {\$}7.0\backslashsigma{\$}. Subtracting the best available estimate for foreground dust modifies the likelihood slightly so that r=0 is disfavored at {\$}5.9\backslashsigma{\$}.},

abstract = {The full sky cosmic microwave background polarization field can be decomposed into ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' components. Working in harmonic space we construct window functions that allow clean separation of the electric and magnetic modes from observations over only a portion of the sky. We explicitly demonstrate the method for azimuthally symmetric patches, but also present it in a form in principle applicable to arbitrarily shaped patches. From the window functions we obtain variables that allow for robust estimation of the magnetic component without risk of contamination from the probably much larger electric signal. The variables have a very simple noise properties, and further analysis using them should be no harder than analyzing the temperature field. For an azimuthally symmetric patch, such as that obtained from survey missions when the galactic region is removed, the exactly separated variables are fast to compute. We estimate the magnetic signal that could be detected by the Planck satellite in the absence of extra-galactic foregrounds. We also discuss the sensitivity of future experiments to tensor modes in the presence of a magnetic signal generated by weak lensing, and give lossless methods for analyzing the electric polarization field in the case that the magnetic component is negligible. A series of Appendixes review the spin weight formalism and give recursion relations for fast computation of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics and their inner products over azimuthally symmetric patches of the sphere. A further Appendix discusses the statistics of weak signal detection.},

abstract = {We apply a new method to measure primordial non-Gaussianity, using the cross-correlation between galaxy surveys and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing signal to measure galaxy bias on very large scales, where local-type primordial non-Gaussianity predicts a k2 divergence. We use the CMB lensing map recently published by the Planck Collaboration, and measure its external correlations with a suite of six galaxy catalogues spanning a broad redshift range. We then consistently combine correlation functions to extend the recent analysis by Giannantonio et al., where the density-density and the density-CMB temperature correlations were used. Due to the intrinsic noise of the Planck lensing map, which affects the largest scales most severely, we find that the constraints on the galaxy bias are similar to the constraints from density-CMB temperature correlations. Including lensing constraints only improves the previous statistical measurement errors marginally, and we obtain fNL = 12 ± 21 (1$\sigma$) from the combined data set. However, the lensing measurements serve as an excellent test of systematic errors: we now have three methods to measure the large-scale, scale-dependent bias from a galaxy survey: auto-correlation, and cross-correlation with both CMB temperature and lensing. As the publicly available Planck lensing maps have had their largest scale modes at multipoles l {\textless} 10 removed, which are the most sensitive to the scale-dependent bias, we consider mock CMB lensing data covering all multipoles. We find that, while the effect of fNL indeed increases significantly on the largest scales, so do the contributions of both cosmic variance and the intrinsic lensing noise, so that the improvement is small.},

abstract = {Scale-discretised wavelets yield a directional wavelet framework on the sphere where a signal can be probed not only in scale and position but also in orientation. Furthermore, a signal can be synthesised from its wavelet coefficients exactly, in theory and practice (to machine precision). Scale-discretised wavelets are closely related to spherical needlets (both were developed independently at about the same time) but relax the axisymmetric property of needlets so that directional signal content can be probed. Needlets have been shown to satisfy important quasi-exponential localisation and asymptotic uncorrelation properties. We show that these properties also hold for directional scale-discretised wavelets on the sphere and derive similar localisation and uncorrelation bounds in both the scalar and spin settings. Scale-discretised wavelets can thus be considered as directional needlets.},

Our projections are based on combining expected small-scale E-mode polarization measurements from Advanced ACTPol in the range {\$}300{\textless}\backslashell{\textless}3000{\$} with simulated temperature data from the full Planck mission in the low and intermediate {\$}\backslashell{\$} region, {\$}2{\textless}\backslashell{\textless}2000{\$}. We show that the six basic cosmological parameters determined from this combination of data will predict the underlying primordial temperature spectrum at high multipoles to better than {\$}1\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy. Assuming an efficient cleaning from multi-frequency channels of most foregrounds in the temperature data, we investigate the sensitivity to the only residual secondary component, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) term. The CMB polarization is used to break degeneracies between primordial and secondary terms present in temperature and, in effect, to remove from the temperature data all but the residual kSZ term. We estimate a {\$}15 \backslashsigma{\$} detection of the diffuse homogeneous kSZ signal from expected AdvACT temperature data at {\$}\backslashell{\textgreater}1500{\$}, leading to a measurement of the amplitude of matter density fluctuations, {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$}, at {\$}1\backslash{\%}{\$} precision. Alternatively, by exploring the reionization signal encoded in the patchy kSZ measurements, we bound the time and duration of the reionization with {\$}\backslashsigma(z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm re{\}})=1.1{\$} and {\$}\backslashsigma(\backslashDelta z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm re{\}})=0.2{\$}. We find that these constraints degrade rapidly with large beam sizes, which highlights the importance of arcminute-scale resolution for future CMB surveys.},

abstract = {We present a new derivation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectrum from the Ostriker-Vishniac effect for an open, flat, or closed Universe, and calculate the anisotropy expected in cold dark-matter (CDM) models. We provide simple semi-analytic fitting formulas for the Vishniac power spectrum that can be used to evaluate the expected anisotropy in CDM models for any arbitrary ionization history. In a flat Universe, CDM models normalized to cluster abundances produce rms temperature anisotropies of 0.8--2.4 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}K on arcminute angular scales for a constant ionization fraction of unity, whereas an ionization fraction of 0.2 yields rms anisotropies of 0.3--0.8 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}K. In an open and/or high-baryon-density Universe, the level of anisotropy is somewhat higher. The signal in some of these models may be detectable with planned interferometry experiments. The damping of the acoustic peaks in the primary-anisotropy spectrum at degree angular scales depends primarily on the optical depth and only secondarily on the epoch of reionization. On the other hand, the amplitude of Ostriker-Vishniac anisotropies depends sensitively on the epoch of reionization. Therefore, when combined with the estimate of the reionization optical depth provided by maps of degree-scale anisotropies, the Ostriker-Vishniac effect can provide a unique probe of the epoch of reionization.},

abstract = {Understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modern observational cosmology. Utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volume limited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from the SDSS galaxy catalog. In the largest such analysis to date, we study the angular clustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. Using Limber's equation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set as r0=5.77+/-0.10 Mpc/h. We find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of 1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshift surveys. We also find that both the clustering length and the slope of the correlation function depend on the galaxy type. In particular, by splitting the galaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior in their clustering properties. Galaxies with spectral types similar to elliptical galaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 Mpc/h and a slope of the angular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have a clustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 Mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. The two intermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', rather than showing a gradual transition in slope. We discuss these correlations in the context of current cosmological models for structure formation.},

(We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

We strongly detect the effects of primordial helium and neutrinos on the CMB; a model without helium is rejected at 7.7$\sigma$, while a model without neutrinos is rejected at 7.5$\sigma$. The primordial helium abundance is measured to be Yp = 0.296 ± 0.030, and the effective number of relativistic species is measured to be N eff = 3.85 ± 0.62. The constraints on these models are strengthened when the CMB data are combined with measurements of the Hubble constant and the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Notable improvements include ns = 0.9668 ± 0.0093, r {\textless} 0.17 (95{\%} CL), and N eff = 3.86 ± 0.42. The SPT+WMAP data show a mild preference for low power in the CMB damping tail, and while this preference may be accommodated by models that have a negative spectral running, a high primordial helium abundance, or a high effective number of relativistic species, such models are disfavored by the abundance of low-redshift galaxy clusters.},

In these models, the gravitational potential perturbations begin to evolve at late times. Photons passing through these time varying potentials aquire frequency shifts, an effect first noted by Rees and Sciama. Since the gravitational potential is associated with matter at observable redshifts, the local matter density (or some tracer thereof) is correlated with the CMB anisotropy on the sky. We outline the optimal method of measuring this correlation, and discuss the prospects for using an X-ray/COBE comparison to detect a cosmological constant.},

Careful removal of the background from galactic cirrus is essential, and currently dominates the uncertainty in our measurements.

For our 350 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$m-selected samples we detect relatively strong clustering with correlation amplitudes A of 0.2 and 1.2 at 1', but with relatively large uncertainties. For samples which preferentially select high redshift galaxies at z{\~{}}2-3 we detect significant strong clustering, leading to an estimate of r0 {\~{}} 7-11 h-1 Mpc.

abstract = {Weak lensing of CMB anisotropies and polarization for the power spectra and higher order statistics can be handled directly in harmonic-space without recourse to real-space correlation functions. For the power spectra, this approach not only simplifies the calculations but is also readily generalized from the usual flat-sky approximation to the exact all-sky form by replacing Fourier harmonics with spherical harmonics. Counterintuitively, because of the nonlinear nature of the effect, errors in the flat-sky approximation do not improve on smaller scales. They remain at the 10{\%} level through the acoustic regime and are sufficiently large to merit adoption of the all-sky formalism. For the bispectra, a cosmic variance limited detection of the correlation with secondary anisotropies has an order of magnitude greater signal-to-noise for combinations involving magnetic parity polarization than those involving the temperature alone. Detection of these bispectra will, however, be severely noise and foreground limited even with the Planck satellite, leaving room for improvement with higher sensitivity experiments. We also provide a general study of the correspondence between flat and all sky potentials, deflection angles, convergence and shear for the power spectra and bispectra.},

@article{Kirk2016,
abstract = {We measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and of the cos-mic microwave background (CMB) on the same patch of sky. The effects of gravitational lensing on different sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same mass fluctuations. We use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg 2 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification data and overlapping CMB lensing from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck. The DES source galaxies have a median redshift of z med ∼0.7, while the CMB lensing kernel is broad and peaks at z∼2. The resulting cross-correlation is maximally sensitive to mass fluctuations at z∼0.44. Assuming the Planck 2015 best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the DES×SPT cross-power is found to be A SPT = 0.88 ± 0.30 and that from DES×Planck to be A Planck = 0.86 ± 0.39, where A = 1 corresponds to the theoretical predic-tion and the errors are 68{\%} confidence limits. These are consistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of 2.9$\sigma$ and 2.2$\sigma$ respectively. We demonstrate that our re-sults are robust to a number of important systematic effects including the shear measurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and CMB lensing systematics. Significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes would increase the cross-correlation signal in-ferred from the data; we calculate a value of A = 1.08 ± 0.36 for DES×SPT when we correct the observations with a simple IA model. With three measurements of this cross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliable evidence for any deviation from the expected LCDM level of cross-correlation, given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact of systematic errors, particularly IAs. Future data sets, including those from upcoming releases of DES and SPT, will cover more sky area and provide both greater depth and higher resolution, making this correlation a potentially very powerful cosmological tool. We provide forecasts for the expected signal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year DES survey and SPT-3G.},

@article{Sheth2001,
abstract = {The Press-Schechter, excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. The approach combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. The predicted mass function is reasonably accurate, although it has fewer high-mass and more low-mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. We show that the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical, collapse. In the original, standard, spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, $\delta$sc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, this means that $\delta$sc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. In Gaussian random fields, the distribution of these quantities depends on the size of the region considered. Since the mass of a region is related to its initial size, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this $\delta$ec(m) relation which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high-resolution N-body simulations, and use our new formulation of the approach to show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents an improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large-scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.},

However, there are many sources of NG in CMB anisotropies, beyond the primordial one, which can contaminate the primordial signal. We mainly focus on the NG generated from the post-inflationary evolution of the CMB anisotropies at second-order in perturbation theory at large and small angular scales, such as the ones generated at the recombination epoch. We show how to derive the equations to study the second-order CMB anisotropies and provide analytical computations to evaluate their contamination to primordial NG (complemented with numerical examples).

We simultaneously fit for neutrino mass and dark energy equation of state including time variation and early dark energy density, and compare the use of polarization power spectra with an optimal quadratic estimator of the lensing. Results are given as a function of systematics level from residual foreground contamination. A realistic CMBpol experiment can effectively constrain the sum of neutrino masses to within 0.05 eV and the fraction of early dark energy to 0.002.

abstract = {We develop an exact wavelet transform on the three-dimensional ball (i.e. on the solid sphere), which we name the flaglet transform. For this purpose we first construct an exact transform on the radial half-line using damped Laguerre polynomials and develop a corresponding quadrature rule. Combined with the spherical harmonic transform, this approach leads to a sampling theorem on the ball and a novel three-dimensional decomposition which we call the Fourier-Laguerre transform. We relate this new transform to the well-known Fourier-Bessel decomposition and show that band-limitedness in the Fourier-Laguerre basis is a sufficient condition to compute the Fourier-Bessel decomposition exactly. We then construct the flaglet transform on the ball through a harmonic tiling, which is exact thanks to the exactness of the Fourier-Laguerre transform (from which the name flaglets is coined). The corresponding wavelet kernels are well localised in real and Fourier-Laguerre spaces and their angular aperture is invariant under radial translation. We introduce a multiresolution algorithm to perform the flaglet transform rapidly, while capturing all information at each wavelet scale in the minimal number of samples on the ball. Our implementation of these new tools achieves floating-point precision and is made publicly available. We perform numerical experiments demonstrating the speed and accuracy of these libraries and illustrate their capabilities on a simple denoising example.},

abstract = {Constraining cosmological parameters from measurements of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect requires developing robust and accurate methods for computing statistical errors in the cross-correlation between maps. This paper presents a detailed comparison of such error estimation applied to the case of cross-correlation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We compare theoretical models for error estimation with montecarlo simulations where both the galaxy and the CMB maps vary around a fiducial auto-correlation and cross-correlation model which agrees well with the current concordance LCDM cosmology. Our analysis compares estimators both in harmonic and configuration (or real) space, quantifies the accuracy of the error analysis and discuss the impact of partial sky survey area and the choice of input fiducial model on dark-energy constraints. We show that purely analytic approaches yield accurate errors even in surveys that cover only 10{\%} of the sky and that parameter constraints strongly depend on the fiducial model employed. Alternatively, we discuss the advantages and limitations of error estimators that can be directly applied to data. In particular, we show that errors and covariances from the Jack-Knife method agree well with the theoretical approaches and simulations. We also introduce a novel method in real space that is computationally efficient and can be applied to real data and realistic survey geometries. Finally, we present a number of new findings and prescriptions that can be useful for analysis of real data and forecasts, and present a critical summary of the analyses done to date.},

abstract = {We study reconstruction of the lensing potential power spectrum from CMB temperature data, with an eye to the Planck experiment. We work with the optimal quadratic estimator of Okamoto and Hu, which we characterize thoroughly in application to reconstruction of the lensing power spectrum. We find that at multipoles L{\textless}250 our current understanding of this estimator is biased at the 15{\%} level by beyond-gradient terms in the Taylor expansion of lensing effects. We present the full lensed trispectrum to fourth order in the lensing potential to explain this effect. We show that the low-L bias, as well as a previously known bias at high-L, is relevant to the determination of cosmology and must be corrected for in order to avoid significant parameter errors. We also investigate the covariance of the reconstructed power, finding broad correlations of {\~{}}0.1{\%}.

abstract = {The evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe and the time-dependence of the fine-structure constant suggests the existence of at least one scalar field with a mass of order H{\_}0. If such a field exists, then it is generally assumed that its coupling to matter must be tuned to unnaturally small values in order to satisfy the tests of the Equivalence Principle (EP). In this paper, we present an alternative explanation which allows scalar fields to evolve cosmologically while having couplings to matter of order unity. In our scenario, the mass of the fields depends on the local matter density: the interaction range is typically of order 1 mm on Earth (where the density is high) and of order 10-10{\^{}}4 AU in the solar system (where the density is low). All current bounds from tests of General Relativity are satisfied. Nevertheless, we predict that near-future experiments that will test gravity in space will measure an effective Newton's constant different by order unity from that on Earth, as well as EP violations stronger than currently allowed by laboratory experiments. Such outcomes would constitute a smoking gun for our scenario.},

We then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic fields, such as correlation functions in real and Fourier space, probability distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non-Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First, we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing. We finally review the current observational situation regarding statistics in galaxy catalogs and what the future generation of galaxy surveys promises to deliver.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study of the ISW effect from the Planck 2015 temperature and polarization data release. The CMB is cross-correlated with different LSS tracers: the NVSS, SDSS and WISE catalogues, and the Planck 2015 convergence lensing map. This cross-correlation yields a detection at {\$}4\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$}, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the Planck lensing and NVSS. In fact, the ISW effect is detected only from the Planck data (through the ISW-lensing bispectrum) at {\$}\backslashapprox 3\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$}, which is similar to the detection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming from all the catalogues. This cross-correlation analysis is performed only with the Planck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015 release do not permit significant improvement of the CMB-LSS cross-correlation detectability. Nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalously large ISW signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stacked CMB features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflict with {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM expectations. We find that the current Planck polarization data do not reject that this signal could be caused by the ISW effect. In addition, the stacking of the Planck lensing map on the superstructures' locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scale structures. Finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the ISW temperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all the previously mentioned LSS tracers. In particular, we construct a map of the ISW secondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained from simulations. We also explore the reconstruction of the ISW anisotropies caused by the LSS traced by the 2MPZ survey, by directly inverting the density field into the gravitational potential field.},

abstract = {The nominal mission maps from the Planck satellite contain a wealth of information about secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), including those induced by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and gravitational lensing. As both the tSZ and CMB lensing signals trace the large-scale matter density field, the anisotropies sourced by these processes are expected to be correlated. We report the first detection of this cross-correlation signal, which we measure at 6.2 sigma significance using the Planck data. We take advantage of Planck's multifrequency coverage to construct a tSZ map using internal linear combination techniques, which we subsequently cross-correlate with the publicly-released Planck CMB lensing potential map. [Abridged] We interpret the signal using halo model calculations, which indicate that the tSZ -- CMB lensing cross-correlation is a unique probe of the physics of intracluster gas in high-redshift, low-mass groups and clusters. Our results are consistent with extrapolations of existing gas physics models to this previously unexplored regime and show clear evidence for contributions from both the one- and two-halo terms, but no statistically significant evidence for contributions from diffuse, unbound gas outside of collapsed halos. We also show that the amplitude of the signal depends rather sensitively on the amplitude of fluctuations ({\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$}) and the matter density ({\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\$}). We constrain the degenerate combination {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8 (\backslashOmega{\_}m/0.282){\^{}}{\{}0.26{\}} = 0.824 \backslashpm 0.029{\$}, a result that is in less tension with primordial CMB constraints than some recent tSZ analyses.

Particular attention is paid to how a scalar (density) perturbation might be generated by stress perturbations at very early times, when the non-gauge-invariant perturbation in the density itself is ill-defined. The amplitude of fractional energy density perturbation at the particle horizon cannot be larger, in order of magnitude, than the maximum ratio of the stress perturbation to the bacground energy density at any earlier time, unless the perturbation is inherent in the initial singularity.},

abstract = {The current flow of high accuracy astrophysical data, among which are the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, offers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the inflationary theory. This is however a challenging project given the size of the inflationary landscape which contains hundreds of different scenarios. Given that there is currently no observational evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature perturbations or any other non-minimal extension of the inflationary paradigm, a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models first, namely the slow-roll single field models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and efficient strategies. It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of approximate model independent methods while a more ambitious alternative is to study the inflationary scenarios one by one. We have developed the new publicly available runtime library ASPIC11http://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/ ringeval/aspic.html. to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating consistent observable predictions within this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an evolutive code which presently supports 74 different models, a number that may be compared with three or four representing the present state of the art. In this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in a systematic manner, thereby constituting the first Encyclop??dia Inflationaris. Finally, we discuss how this procedure and ASPIC could be used to determine the best model of inflation by means of Bayesian inference.},

abstract = {We measure the correlation of galaxy lensing and cosmic microwave background lensing with a set of galaxies expected to trace the matter density field. The measurements are performed using pre-survey Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification optical imaging data and millimeter-wave data from the 2500 square degree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. The two lensing-galaxy correlations are jointly fit to extract constraints on cosmological parameters, constraints on the redshift distribution of the lens galaxies, and constraints on the absolute shear calibration of DES galaxy lensing measurements. We show that an attractive feature of these fits is that they are fairly insensitive to the clustering bias of the galaxies used as matter tracers.

abstract = {Gravitational lensing due to the large-scale distribution of matter in the cosmos distorts the primordial Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and thereby induces new, small-scale {\$}B{\$}-mode polarization. This signal carries detailed information about the distribution of all the gravitating matter between the observer and CMB last scattering surface. We report the first direct evidence for polarization lensing based on purely CMB information, from using the four-point correlations of even- and odd-parity {\$}E{\$}- and {\$}B{\$}-mode polarization mapped over {\$}\backslashsim30{\$} square degrees of the sky measured by the POLARBEAR experiment. These data were analyzed using a blind analysis framework and checked for spurious systematic contamination using null tests and simulations. Evidence for the signal of polarization lensing and lensing {\$}B{\$}-modes is found at 4.2{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} (stat.+sys.) significance. The amplitude of matter fluctuations is measured with a precision of {\$}27\backslash{\%}{\$}, and is found to be consistent with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ({\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM) cosmological model. This measurement demonstrates a new technique, capable of mapping all gravitating matter in the Universe, sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses, and essential for cleaning the lensing {\$}B{\$}-mode signal in searches for primordial gravitational waves.},

abstract = {We present a detailed investigation of the impact of astrophysical processes on the shape and amplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch. This is achieved by constructing a new model of the kSZ power spectrum which we calibrate to the results of hydrodynamic simulations. By construction, our method accounts for all relevant density and velocity modes and so is unaffected by the limited box size of our simulations. We find that radiative cooling and star-formation can reduce the amplitude of the kSZ power spectrum by up to 33{\%}, or 1 uK{\^{}}2 at ell = 3000. This is driven by a decrease in the mean gas density in groups and clusters due to the conversion of gas into stars. Variations in the redshifts at which helium reionization occurs can effect the amplitude by a similar fraction, while current constraints on cosmological parameters (namely sigma{\_}8) translate to a further +-15{\%} uncertainty on the kSZ power spectrum. We demonstrate how the models presented in this work can be constrained -- reducing the astrophysical uncertainty on the kSZ signal -- by measuring the redshift dependence of the signal via kSZ tomography. Finally, we discuss how the results of this work can help constrain the duration of reionization via measurements of the kinetic SZ signal sourced by inhomogeneous (or patchy) reionization.},

We describe in detail a pipeline for data reduction using customised procedures within HIPE from data retrieval to the production of science-quality images. We found that the standard procedure for removing Cosmic-Ray glitches also removed parts of bright sources and so implemented an effective two-stage process to minimise these problems. The pronounced 1/f noise is removed from the timelines using 3.4- and 2.5-arcmin boxcar high-pass filters at 100 and 160-um. Empirical measurements of the point-spread function (PSF) are used to determine the encircled energy fraction as a function of aperture size. For the 100- and 160-um bands, the effective PSFs are {\~{}}9 and {\~{}}13 arcsec (FWHM), and the 90-per-cent encircled energy radii are 13 and 18 arcsec. Astrometric accuracy is good to {\~{}}{\textless}2 arcsec. The noise in the final maps is correlated between neighbouring pixels and rather higher than advertised prior to launch. For a pair of cross-scans, the 5-sigma point-source sensitivities are 125-165 mJy for 9-13-arcsec radius apertures at 100-um and 150-240 mJy for 13-18-arcsec radius apertures at 160-um.},

SPT-SZ survey area. Data in the three SPT-SZ frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, are used to produce six angular power spectra (three single-frequency auto-spectra and three cross-spectra) covering the multipole range 2000 {\textless} ell {\textless} 11000 (angular scales 5' {\textgreater} $\backslash$theta {\textgreater} 1'). These are the most precise measurements of the angular power spectra at ell {\textgreater} 2500 at these frequencies. The main contributors to the power spectra at these angular scales and frequencies are the primary CMB, CIB, thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects (tSZ and kSZ), and radio galaxies. We include a constraint on the tSZ power from a measurement of the tSZ bispectrum from 800 sq.deg. of the SPT-SZ survey. We measure the tSZ power at 143 GHz to be DtSZ = 4.08 +0.58 -0.67 $\backslash$mu K{\^{}}2 and the kSZ power to be DkSZ = 2.9 +- 1.3 $\backslash$mu K{\^{}}2. The data prefer positive kSZ power at 98.1{\%} CL. We measure a correlation coefficient of $\backslash$xi = 0.113 +0.057 -0.054 between sources of tSZ and CIB power, with $\backslash$xi {\textless} 0 disfavored at a confidence level of 99.0{\%}. The constraint on kSZ power can be interpreted as an upper limit on the duration of reionization. When the post-reionization homogeneous kSZ signal is accounted for, we find an upper limit on the duration $\backslash$Delta z {\textless} 5.4 at 95{\%} CL.},

abstract = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter $\Omega$ decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data. This method is more accurate than the commonly used Peacock-Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra.

abstract = {Using the formalism of spin-weighted functions we present an all-sky analysis of polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor, which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin {\$}\backslashpm 2{\$} spherical harmonics. These are the analog of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations. We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin {\$}\backslashpm 2{\$} multipole moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize the statistical properties of polarization in the CMB. Magnetic-type parity combination does not receieve contributions from scalar modes and does not cross-correlate with either temperature or electric-type parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their explicit expressions for scalar and tensor modes in the form of line of sight integral solution and numerically evaluate them for a representative set of models. These general solutions differ from the expressions obtained previously in the small scale limit both for scalar and tensor modes. A method to generate and analyze all sky maps of temperature and polarization is given and the optimal estimators for various power spectra and their corresponding variances are discussed.},

The bias-hardened estimators which we present can have reduced sensitivity to such uncertainties, and provide a desirable cross-check on standard results. To test our approach, we also show the results of lensing reconstruction from simulated temperature maps given on 100 deg{\^{}}2, and confirm that our approach works well to reduce biases for a typical masked map in which 70 square masks each having 10 arcminute on a side exist, covering 2{\%} of the simulated map, which is similar to the masks used in the current SPT lensing analysis.},

We compare our results with semi-analytical approximations implemented in Boltzmann codes like, e.g., CAMB.

Using the mass map from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and a newly-constructed tSZ map from Planck, we measure a non-zero correlation between the two maps out to one degree angular separation on the sky, with an overall significance of 6 sigma. The tSZ maps are formed in a manner that removes primary cosmic microwave background fluctuations and minimizes residual contamination by galactic and extragalactic dust emission, and by CO line emission. We perform numerous tests to show that our measurement is immune to these residual contaminants. The resulting correlation function is consistent with the existence of a warm baryonic gas tracing the large scale structure with a bias b{\_}gas. Given the shape of the lensing kernel, our signal sensitivity peaks at a redshift z{\~{}}0.4, where half a degree separation on the sky corresponds to a physical scale of {\~{}}10 Mpc. The amplitude of the signal constrains the product (b{\_}gas/1)(T{\_}e / 0.1 keV)(n{\_}e / 1 m{\^{}}-3)=2.01$\backslash$pm 0.31$\backslash$pm 0.21, at redshift zero. Our study suggests that a substantial fraction of the "missing" baryons in the universe may reside in a low density warm plasma that traces dark matter.},

We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in terms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of 83{\%} on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the Y5R500 estimates are robust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate conversion to Y500 requires. the use of prior information on the cluster extent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary data, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical and X-ray data-sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart match. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a population of low-redshift X-ray under- luminous clusters revealed by SZ selection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent properties for their mass, but are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected samples.},

abstract = {The polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the main foreground present in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at frequencies above 100GHz.

These will bring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determination of the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. We show that statistical properties of the emission can be characterized over large fractions of the sky using {\$}C{\_}\backslashell{\$}. For the dust, they are well described by power laws in {\$}\backslashell{\$} with exponents {\$}\backslashalpha{\^{}}{\{}EE,BB{\}}=-2.42\backslashpm0.02{\$}. The amplitudes of the polarization {\$}C{\_}\backslashell{\$} vary with the average brightness in a way similar to the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence is consistent with modified blackbody emission with {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}d=1.59{\$} and {\$}T{\_}d=19.6{\$}K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the Galactic {\$}B{\$}- and {\$}E{\$}-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no "clean" windows where primordial CMB {\$}B{\$}-mode polarization could be measured without subtraction of dust emission. Finally, we investigate the level of dust polarization in the BICEP2 experiment field.

abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega{\_}m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95{\%} upper limit of r{\textless}0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N{\_}eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N{\_}eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

abstract = {The next generation weak lensing surveys (i.e., LSST, Euclid and WFIRST) will require exquisite control over systematic effects. In this paper, we address shear calibration and present the most realistic forecast to date for LSST/Euclid/WFIRST and CMB lensing from a stage 4 CMB experiment (CMB S4). We use the CosmoLike code to simulate a joint analysis of all the two-point functions of galaxy density, galaxy shear and CMB lensing convergence. We include the full Gaussian and non-Gaussian covariances and explore the resulting joint likelihood with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We constrain shear calibration biases while simultaneously varying cosmological parameters, galaxy biases and photometric redshift uncertainties. We find that CMB lensing from CMB S4 enables the calibration of the shear biases down to 0.2{\%} - 3{\%} in 10 tomographic bins for LSST (below the {\~{}}0.5{\%} requirements in most tomographic bins), down to 0.4{\%} - 2.4{\%} in 10 bins for Euclid and 0.6{\%} - 3.2{\%} in 10 bins for WFIRST. For a given lensing survey, the method works best at high redshift where shear calibration is otherwise most challenging. This self-calibration is robust to Gaussian photometric redshift uncertainties and to a reasonable level of intrinsic alignment. It is also robust to changes in the beam and the effectiveness of the component separation of the CMB experiment, and slowly dependent on its depth, making it possible with third generation CMB experiments such as AdvACT and SPT-3G, as well as the Simons Observatory.},

abstract = {The imprint of the cross-correlation of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) and lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has recently been detected in the bispectrum of temperature maps. In this paper, we use the optimised skew-spectrum as well as skew-spectra associated with Minkowski Functionals (MFs) to test the possibility of using this signal to detect deviations in the theory of gravity away from General Relativity (GR). We find that the although both statistics can put constraints on modified gravity, the optimised skew-spectra are especially sensitive to the parameter {\$}\backslashrB{\_}0{\$} that denotes the the {\{}$\backslash$em Compton wavelength{\}} of the scalaron at the present epoch, and both can be used to put stringent constraints on any departure from GR, or pinpoint any systematics in the data. We investigate three modified gravity theories, namely: the Post-Parametrised Friedmanian (PPF) formalism; the Hu-Sawicki (HS) model; and the Bertschinger-Zukin (BZ) formalism. Employing a likelihood analysis for an experimental setup similar to ESA's Planck mission, we find that, assuming GR to be the correct model, we expect the constraints from the first two skew-spectra, {\$}S{\_}{\{}\backslashell{\}}{\^{}}{\{}(0){\}}{\$} and {\$}S{\_}{\{}\backslashell{\}}{\^{}}{\{}(1){\}}{\$}, to be the same: {\$}\backslashrm B{\_}0{\textless}0.45{\$} at {\$}95\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence level (CL), and {\$}\backslashrm B{\_}0{\textless}0.67{\$} at {\$}99\backslash{\%}{\$} CL in the BZ model. The third skew-spectrum does not give any meaningful constraint. The performance of MFs can be improved by using Wiener-type filtering, but we find that the optimal skew-spectrum is much more powerful, giving {\$}\backslashrm B{\_}0{\textless}0.071{\$} at {\$}95\backslash{\%}{\$} CL and {\$}\backslashrm B{\_}0{\textless}0.15{\$} at {\$}99\backslash{\%}{\$} CL, which is a factor of six improvement compared to constraints derived from MF, and essentially identical to what can be achieved using the full bispectrum.},

This method presents three main useful properties: (1) no estimation of the noise power spectrum is needed; (2) complex weighting schemes including sky covering and map noise properties can be easily taken into account, and corrected for, for each input map; and (3) error bars are quickly computed analytically from the data themselves with no Monte Carlo simulations involved.

While the halofit model has frequently been used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low resolution of N-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of an improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution N-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe best-fit cosmological parameters (one-, three-, five-, and seven-year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the N-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumbers (k {\textless}= 30 h Mpc-1) at redshifts 0 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 10, with 5{\%} precision for k {\textless}= 1 h Mpc-1 at 0 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 10 and 10{\%} for 1 {\textless}= k {\textless}= 10 h Mpc-1 at 0 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 3.

abstract = {We study the matter and velocity divergence power spectra in a f(R) gravity theory and their time evolution measured from several large-volume N-body simulations with varying box sizes and resolution. We find that accurate prediction of the matter power spectrum in f(R) gravity places stronger requirements on the simulation than is the case with {\{}Lambda{\}} cold dark matter ({\{}Lambda{\}}CDM) because of the non-linear nature of the fifth force. Linear perturbation theory is shown to be a poor approximation for the f(R) models, except when the chameleon effect is very weak. We show that the relative differences from the fiducial {\{}Lambda{\}}CDM model are much more pronounced in the non-linear tail of the velocity divergence power spectrum than in the matter power spectrum, which suggests that future surveys which target the collection of peculiar velocity data will open new opportunities to constrain modified gravity theories. A close investigation of the time evolution of the power spectra shows that there is a pattern in the evolution history, which can be explained by the properties of the chameleon-type fifth force in f(R) gravity. Varying the model parameter |fR0|, which quantifies the strength of the departure from standard gravity, mainly varies the epoch marking the onset of the fifth force, as a result of which the different f(R) models are in different stages of the same evolutionary path at any given time.},

abstract = {We consider the weak lensing effect induced by linear cosmological perturbations on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization anisotropies. We find that the amplitude of the lensing peak in the BB mode power spectrum is a faithful tracer of the dark energy dynamics at the onset of cosmic acceleration. This is due to two reasons. First, the lensing power is non-zero only at intermediate redshifts between the observer and the source, keeping record of the linear perturbation growth rate at the corresponding epoch. Second, the BB lensing signal is expected to dominate over the other sources. The lensing distortion on the TT and EE spectra do exhibit a similar dependence on the dark energy dynamics, although those are dominated by primary anisotropies. We investigate and quantify the effect by means of exact tracking quintessence models, as well as parameterizing the dark energy equation of state in terms of the present value ({\$}w{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$}) and its asymptotic value in the past ({\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashinfty{\}}{\$}); in the interval allowed by the present constraints on dark energy, the variation of {\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashinfty{\}}{\$} induces a significant change in the BB mode lensing amplitude. A Fisher matrix analysis, under conservative assumptions concerning the increase of the sample variance due to the lensing non-Gaussian statistics, shows that a precision of order 10{\%} on both {\$}w{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$} and {\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashinfty{\}}{\$} is achievable by the future experiments probing a large sky area with angular resolution and sensitivity appropriate to detect the lensing effect on the CMB angular power spectrum. These results show that the CMB can probe the differential redshift behavior of the dark energy equation of state, beyond its average.},

@article{Ma1995,
abstract = {This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM+HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works. Isentropic initial conditions on super-horizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM+HDM models with neutrino mass densities {\$}\backslashonu=0.2{\$} and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two CDM+HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics/ .},

abstract = {We measure the cross-correlation signature between the Planck CMB lensing map and the weak lensing observations from both the Red-sequence Cluster Lensing Survey (RCSLenS) and the Canada-France-Hawai Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). In addition to a Fourier analysis, we include the first configuration-space detection, based on the estimators {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashkappa{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CMB{\}} \backslashkappa{\_}{\{}\backslashrm gal{\}} \backslashrangle{\$} and {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashkappa{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CMB{\}} \backslashgamma{\_}{\{}t{\}} \backslashrangle{\$}. Combining 747.2 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} from both surveys, we find a detection significance that exceeds {\$}4.2\backslashsigma{\$} in both Fourier- and configuration-space analyses. Scaling the predictions by a free parameter {\$}A{\$}, we obtain {\$}A{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm Planck{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CFHT{\}}= 0.68\backslashpm 0.31 {\$} and {\$}A{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm Planck{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm RCS{\}}= 1.31\backslashpm 0.33{\$}. In preparation for the next generation of measurements similar to these, we quantify the impact of different analysis choices on these results. First, since none of these estimators probes the exact same dynamical range, we improve our detection by combining them. Second, we carry out a detailed investigation on the effect of apodization, zero-padding and mask multiplication, validated on a suite of high-resolution simulations, and find that the latter produces the largest systematic bias in the cosmological interpretation. Finally, we show that residual contamination from intrinsic alignment and the effect of photometric redshift error are both largely degenerate with the characteristic signal from massive neutrinos, however the signature of baryon feedback might be easier to distinguish. The three lensing datasets are now publicly available.},

@article{Dossett2014,
abstract = {In order to explain cosmic acceleration without invoking "dark" physics, we consider {\$}f(R){\$} modified gravity models, which replace the standard Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity with a higher derivative theory. We use data from the WiggleZ Dark Energy survey to probe the formation of structure on large scales which can place tight constraints on these models. We combine the large-scale structure data with measurements of the cosmic microwave background from the Planck surveyor. After parameterising the modification of the action using the Compton wavelength parameter {\$}B{\_}0{\$}, we constrain this parameter using ISiTGR, assuming an initial non-informative log prior probability distribution of this cross-over scale. We find that the addition of the WiggleZ power spectrum provides the tightest constraints to date on {\$}B{\_}0{\$} by an order of magnitude, giving {\$}{\{}\backslashrm log{\}}{\_}{\{}10{\}}(B{\_}0) {\textless} -4.07{\$} at 95{\%} confidence limit. Finally, we test whether the effect of adding the lensing amplitude {\$}A{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Lens{\}}{\$} and the sum of the neutrino mass {\$}\backslashsum m{\_}\backslashnu{\$} is able to reconcile current tensions present in these parameters, but find {\$}f(R){\$} gravity an inadequate explanation.},
